<h2><a name="NONOWITS_HOME" id="NONOWITS_HOME"></a>NONOWIT'S HOME</h2>

<p>Long before New Hampshire found its name, the
deep river at its southeast was known as the Piscataqua
by the Indians who could stem its strong currents,
even in bark canoes.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because of the fresh spring close
to its salty shores, some three miles from the sea,
that the red men made their encampment on the
spot that was later equally attractive to men of
white skins.</p>

<p>Nonowit, like his people, was glad to see the
snows melt away during that spring of 1603. The
bare branches of the oak and maple showed tufts of
browns, reds, and greens. The fish stirred in the
streams, and by the time that Nonowit's forest
home had its roof of thick green foliage the Indians
themselves were astir. For far up the river at the
falls fish could be found in plenty, and that was a
welcome change from the game of the winter food.</p>

<p>The men of the tribe were the first to start afoot
for the fishing spot, while the squaws broke camp,
gathered their belongings, and herded the children.</p>

<p>Nonowit suddenly recalled some sturdy reeds
growing by the salt marsh which he thought would
make fine arrow shafts. It had occurred to the
boy that he might stand by the falls and shoot his
fish as they bounded over. That is why he was not
on the spot when the children were started on the
march, and the last camp fire had been covered.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<p>Even though he was an Indian boy, his heart
thumped with fear, when at the end of the day he
returned from his hunt on the marsh to a deserted
camp. No answer came to his long shrill
call. The sun was setting, and it was of no use to
follow the trail that night, even though he had
known just where his people were to go.</p>

<p>He munched some scraps that had been left behind
and sought the shelter of a hollow oak which
had been the playhouse of the Indian girls and boys.
An old owl hooted and flew from a hole above, but
Nonowit had no fear of him, though he was glad
the hole by which he had crawled into the oak was
far above the ground. This was some protection
from the wolves, which he could even then hear
howling in the distance.</p>

<p>All night there was a beating rain, which washed
away the last trace of the carefully hidden trail of
the Indian travelers. When Nonowit crawled out
into the sunshine the following morning, he could
learn nothing of their direction. To get a wider
view, he wandered through the thick forest to the
river's edge, but there discovered no signs of his
people. "There are so many children in the camp
I might not be missed," he thought and dropped upon
a rock in one little heap of loneliness.</p>

<p>Suddenly he sat very straight, for there beyond
the Narrows he saw a monstrous thing. Could it
be a huge bird with white wings spread? <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>Over the
water it seemed to be coming nearer. Instinctively
he slid into a crevice between the rocks, yet without
moving his gaze. Through the Narrows, under full
sail, came the first ship. Nonowit seemed to become
a part of the brown earth as he wriggled back
into the undergrowth, never moving his wide-open
eyes from this strange sight.</p>

<p>Then came the rattle of chains and the voices of
men. A boat was lowered, and Nonowit, safe under
the cover of the low branches, saw it headed
for his shore. Men with white skin and hair growing
on their faces landed on the very rock on which
he had been sitting. Their clothes were unlike any
he had ever seen before, and their speech could not
be understood. Cautiously he backed into the forest
until he gained the branches of the oak in which
he had slept. Yet that was unsafe, for the white
men looked up into every tree, breaking the
branches and tasting the sap.</p>

<p>In his fright, Nonowit wriggled for safety
through the very hole from which the owl had flown
the night before. There from the dark hollows he
watched the white men as they studied each tree.
They came at last to the old oak and shook its
branches. When one man even climbed far enough
to look deep into the trunk, Nonowit crouched to the
very ground, holding his breath. The shadows protected
him and the men passed on. "Worse than
wolves," thought the boy as he ventured again to
his peep-hole. The white men lingered about for an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
hour or more, until the imprisoned little Indian felt
that he might never see his people again. He would
starve rather than face such creatures.</p>

<p>At last, there came the sound of oars on the
water. Creeping from the tree, Nonowit pushed
aside the low branches to see the boatful of
strangers depart. Suddenly a strong hand was
clapped on his shoulder. He jumped with fear only
to find himself in the grasp of his own father.
Nonowit pointed hastily through the thick growth
to the river, and the two watched the English vessel
sail up the stream, but history reports that Martin
Pring saw no Indians when he searched the Piscataqua
shores for a sassafras tree, which, he believed,
held the "Elixir of Life."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_NEW_WORLD" id="THE_NEW_WORLD"></a>THE NEW WORLD</h2>

<p>Far away on the shores of France, in a little cobbled
lane by the water front, Jacques swung into
the rhythm of the Sailor's Hornpipe. Raoul stood
in the doorway of his low-roofed house, with his
violin, directing the tune and swings until he pronounced
the dance correctly learned.</p>

<p>Just then three well-dressed gentlemen turned
into the narrow way and passed on to the vessel
at the wharf below. The raising of sails and shouting
of orders suggested an immediate start.</p>

<p>Jacques' father hurried around the corner and
motioned to his boy. As Jacques followed, he called
back to Raoul, "I'll bring you an Indian scalp
when I come home!"</p>

<p>The father and son then crossed the narrow plank
to the deck and went below, for their business was
to cook for the crew.</p>

<p>The distinguished-looking gentlemen, however,
talked earnestly on the shore until the last sail was
spread. Then one of them, no other than Monsieur
Champlain, stepped aboard, and, as the gang-plank
was drawn, called to his friends, "We will also mark
the rivers."</p>

<p>And so, long ago in 1605, the French sailed to
the Northwest with new hopes. The Spanish and
Portuguese had returned with wonderful tales of
the mines of South America. Perhaps even greater
things might be found on the Northern shores.</p>

<p>It happened one day when the sea was smooth
and the well-fed sailors had little to do, th<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>at a group
of them gathered on deck with tales of the Americas:
the shining gold to be found there, the wild
beasts, and the wilder Indians. Jacques felt that if
he had but a knife, he could conquer the whole
country. In the meantime his eye rested on a sharp
and ugly-looking one thrust into the belt of a rough
old salt who sat astride the deck rail.</p>

<p>Just then there came a lull in the tales and the
old fellow, to urge on the flagging spirits, brandished
his dirk and pledged it to "The best fellow yet!"</p>

<p>Fierce and impossible yarns followed until Jacques,
as if to work off his excitement, jumped into
the circle with the swing and the stamp of his newly-learned
hornpipe. He danced it well and responded
repeatedly to the sailors' applause. It pleased them
better than any tale told, and they voted Jacques,
"The best fellow yet!" True to his pledge, the old
salt presented the knife with a sweeping bow. Jacques,
overjoyed, at once cut his mark on the handle,
and he dreamed that night of his attack on the New
World. He awoke to make plans for the Indian
scalps he should take to Raoul, for Indians seemed
only as beasts to be slaughtered.</p>

<p>Days and nights of sailing passed, as well as
storms and fogs. When the sun at last brought clear
horizons, the shout of "Land head!" thrilled captain,
mates, and crew. No one knew just where they
were, but shining peaks could be <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>seen in the distance.
At last they came to anchor, and small boats
carried the men ashore. Jacques, too, was allowed
to go. He clutched his knife, expecting to plunge
it into the head of the first red-skin.</p>

<p>A group of Indians stood on the rocks. Monsieur
Champlain, the first to step ashore, greeted them
with friendly signs. Jacques caught sight of an
Indian boy of his own size, lurking behind. He held
a bow in his hand, and a quiver of arrows was slung
across his back. It was Nonowit, for they had landed
on the Piscataqua shores.</p>

<p>The Indian boy gathered wood for the fire, and
Jacques eagerly joined in the search. Soon the older
folk sat about the blaze. The white men tried to
ask where they had landed and what was the nature
of the coast. Jacques, in his desire to learn, drew
in the sand for Nonowit the picture of the ship, the
point of rocks, and the coast. The Indian boy understood
and added the river to the map. That aroused
Monsieur Champlain, who sent an order to the ship
and soon received brilliant beads and various knives
from the stores on board. These he laid at the feet
of the Indians and pointed to the boy's map on the
sand. The red men pulled charred sticks from the
fire and drew on the paper offered the full coast line,
so far as they knew, even to the Merrimac River
with its impeding sandbars, then not even heard of
by white men.</p>

<p>By the time the French had started for their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
vessel Jacques had become sure that the many
stories he had heard of the fierceness of the Indians
were not entirely true, for already he had found
an Indian boy a good companion. Instead of thrusting
his knife into his scalp, he followed the example
of his leaders and laid it at Nonowit's feet. The
little red-skin, pleased with his gift, instinctively
offered to Jacques his bow and arrows. These the
French lad safely tucked away for Raoul, now
thinking it a much finer gift than many scalps.</p>

<p>Monsieur Champlain was even more pleased than
Jacques to carry to his countrymen so true a map of
the coast of the New World, though at that time he
did not know it was to be the map of New England,
nor that he had landed on the New Hampshire
shore.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="VISITORS_FROM_ENGLAND" id="VISITORS_FROM_ENGLAND"></a>VISITORS FROM ENGLAND.</h2>

<p>Eleven years passed and Nonowit was a grown
Indian who knew the forest lands along the Piscataqua
and the rocky turns of the coast. But in all this
time he had not forgotten the two strange experiences
of his boyhood: a sailing vessel, seen in the
river, and later the meeting of white men face to
face. Never did his eye run along the ocean horizon
without thought of those white-winged sails.</p>

<p>One morning in May, 1614, Nonowit paddled miles
from the shore and pulled his canoe upon the
rocks of a small island, the largest of a group that
could be seen from the coast. Leaving his bark in
safety, he crossed to the opposite shore of the island,
where he first laid sticks for a fire and then threw
out his line for a fish. A full catch held his attention
until the tide had risen to an unusual height.
Suddenly he thought of his canoe. He hastened
over the rocks to find it far afloat. There he was
left alone on the island with only the fish of the
ocean for food and the sky to cover his head. That
day and the next he watched for a stray canoe. On
the morning of the third day, as he scanned the
ocean to the East, he discerned a distant white
speck.</p>

<p>Slowly it shaped itself, and he realized that once
again he was watching the approach of a white
man's vessel. It seemed to be heading for his very
island. Nonowit watched cautiously, ready to find
safety<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> in the rocky caves in case these proved unfriendly
people.</p>

<p>The vessel dropped anchor and a small boat
brought eight men ashore. The leader was Capt.
John Smith, who had sailed from England to learn
what he could of the New World, and whether it
was a desirable place for colonists. As this group
of small islands attracted him, he had landed to see
what could be found.</p>

<p>Nonowit, from his hiding place, watched the astonishment
of the white men when they came upon
the burning coals of his fire. Then his turn of surprise
came, for one face of that group was familiar
to him. The features of Jacques had been stamped
upon his boyhood mind, never to be erased. He now
recognized the French boy who, since that first trip
across the ocean, had learned his father's art of
cooking and had hired out as steward to this English
captain.</p>

<p>Springing from his cave, Nonowit appeared before
the wondering men, who drew back, fearing
him one of a band of hidden Indians. Suddenly,
Jacques caught a glimpse of the knife, cut with his
own mark, thrust into the Indian's belt. It was
the very dirk he had won by his well-danced hornpipe
on his voyage with M. Champlain.</p>

<p>After an exchange of friendly greetings, the Indian
led the English party about and visited with
them the smaller islands of the group. The low<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
green bushes and bold rocky shores surrounded by
the sparkling ocean so pleased Captain Smith that
he gave the group his own name, calling Smith's
Isles what later have been known as the Isles of
Shoals.</p>

<p>The seamen learned of Nonowit's lost canoe and
offered to take him ashore. As they approached
the mainland, the wooded coast with its lone mountain
and later the safe harbor and rocky shores were
most attractive to these Englishmen.</p>

<p>On through the Narrows they sailed, as did Martin
Pring many years before. This time, Nonowit
was aboard the vessel that his people watched from
the bank by the fresh spring where they had made
their encampment. It is near the spot where
Portsmouth markets now stand. Perhaps the first
marketing was done that day, for Captain Smith
was ready to trade knives, beads, fish lines, and
hooks for the furs the Indians offered. Jacques prepared
stews and porridge for these new friends,
and in turn the Indians feasted the sailors upon
maize and bear meat.</p>

<p>After Nonowit had well described the coast lines
to Captain Smith, he presented dried fish and deer
meat for the journey, and to Jacques, for his own
use, the skin of a bear. Although Nonowit was
urged to sail with the party, he refused.</p>

<p>Captain Smith continued along the coast to the
point now known as Cape Cod and then, returning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
found others of his party whom he had left fishing
at the mouth of the Penobscot River.</p>

<p>With salted fish and furs from Indian trading,
Captain Smith returned to England, elated with
the charm of the New Land. He published a map
of the seacoast with a vivid description of the country
and presented it to Prince Charles who named
the region New England, and so, ever since, it has
been called.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SETTLEMENT" id="THE_SETTLEMENT"></a>THE SETTLEMENT</h2>

<p>In a little thatched cottage in old Portsmouth of
Hampshire, England, Roger Low sat on a stool by
his father's knee, while the light of the fire flickered
over the heavy settles and on the rafters above.
The man was still in his working clothes, with his
hammer and saw at his side.</p>

<p>"This new world they tell me of, my boy, must
be a wonderful place. Those Puritan leaders,
Bradford and Standish three years ago, in 1620,
took their followers to New England to worship as
they pleased. And now the Laconia Company, of
which our own Governor, John Mason, is a member,
has been given a grant of land there."</p>

<p>"What can he do with it, father?" Roger asked.</p>

<p>"They say, lad, the furs of those forests and the
fish of those waters would make a big business for
England."</p>

<p>A knock at the door brought the man to his feet.
On opening it, he bowed low to the gentleman waiting.</p>

<p>"Come in, sir, and be seated."</p>

<p>David Thompson took the opposite settle, quite
ignoring Roger, who had risen in respect. Absorbed
in his own plans this Scotchman, Thompson,
broke out at once, "Low, I want you to pick up your
tools and come to America with me this spring.
Governor Mason wishes to make a settlement and
proposes to establish a Manor on his new grant. We
will pursue fur trade and fishing, and even hope to
cultivate vines and discover mines."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>
<p>It was an astonishing thought to this carpenter,
whose son was his only companion.</p>

<p>"I should have to take the boy with me," was his
first remark, after some thoughtful moments.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied David Thompson, who knew
that the good workmanship of this man was worth
an extra passenger. "We shall need the boys in a
year or two," he added.</p>

<p>Final arrangements were completed, and in the
spring of 1623, Roger and his father sailed with
the party for New England.</p>

<p>Edward Hilton and his brother William, who had
been fish dealers in London, were on board with
equipment for one settlement, while David Thompson
had charge of the other.</p>

<p>From the map which Captain John Smith had
made, the Piscataqua River was found. Here the
coast was thoroughly studied. Thompson selected
for building the very point at which Monsieur
Champlain once stopped. But the Hilton brothers
preferred river fishing and continued some eight
miles up stream to a point of land called by the Indians,
Winnichannat. It later became a part of
Dover.</p>

<p>Thompson's location was at the mouth of a small
stream, which led to the main river. He called it
Little Harbor. The hillock on which he planned to
build gave a commanding view of the ocean. At
the we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>st stretched a salt marsh, of great value to
a plantation.</p>

<p>Small log cabins were quickly constructed, and
also a secure building for the abundant provisions.
Roger worked with the men in landing barrels of
pork, kegs of molasses, sacks of oats, and boxes of
candles. A securely fastened door not only protected
these supplies from the weather, but also
kept off the prowling beasts that might find comfortable
living on such food.</p>

<p>When the excitement of landing and the newness
of this life began to wear away, the days seemed
much alike. Roger asked one morning, "Father,
shall we see no one but each other again today?"</p>

<p>"That is all, my boy, for the Plymouth Colony is
many miles to the south, and there are only a few
people between that settlement and our own. The
Indians are probably up river now for their
spring fishing."</p>

<p>Roger had been eager to see an Indian, though
he had hoped he might not be alone, for he rather
feared them.</p>

<p>The days wore on with much monotony. The
carpenters were busy building the Manor-house. A
few men were planting only the most necessary
crops. Others were making arrangements for the
manufacture of salt, which was of first importance.
Otherwise fish could not be preserved for the markets
of England.</p>

<p>One day something did happen. At dusk Roger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
passed the cabin where provisions were stored and
found the door wide open. It was a law of the settlement
that that door be kept closed and barred.</p>

<p>The boy darted in to see if any one was there.
Peering about the kegs and boxes he met a pair of
glaring, fiery eyes that glowed through the gloom
between himself and the doorway. He screamed.
The creature crouched. An added horror came
when Roger glanced at the door and saw there the
dark, stern face of a tall Indian with arrow poised.
It was aimed not at Roger, but at the springing
lynx. The whirr of that arrow lived in Roger's
mind the rest of his days. The boy himself was
almost as limp with fright as the creature that was
carried by Nonowit to the main cabin. For this
Indian had heard of the new settlement and had
travelled miles through the forest to make friends
with the white men. He was close behind Roger
and heard his scream of fright when he ran into the
store-house.</p>

<p>The settlers, resting from the day's work, were
surprised at the appearance of the Indian, but still
more astonished by Roger's story. John, the cook,
then confessed that he had come out of the store-house
with his arms full, and had forgotten to go
back and close the door.</p>

<p>The day's excitement was not over, for that night
David Thompson led into camp Captain Miles
Standish of the Plymouth colony. He had a hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
story to tell of the starving condition of his people.
They had compared themselves with the Israelites
during the famine of Egypt, yet the Hebrews had
their flocks and herds left to them. "However,"
continued the captain, "the Lord has been good to
give us the abundant fish of the sea and the spring
water, which is all we have, save a few dried peas."
He then added that Governor Bradford had urged
him to go even as far as Piscataqua to search for
food.</p>

<p>"And little could we have offered him," spoke up
the cook, "if the old lynx and his friends had had a
night in our store-house!"</p>

<p>Much was then given from the ample supply of
the settlement, and Captain Standish returned to
Plymouth well repaid for his journey.</p>

<h2><a name="DANGER_FOR_THE_COLONISTS" id="DANGER_FOR_THE_COLONISTS"></a>DANGER FOR THE COLONISTS.</h2>

<p>Five years had passed since Roger Low and his
father had come to America to help establish the
Mason Manor. Although David Thompson, the leader,
had found an island in Massachusetts Bay more
to his liking, still enough settlers remained at Piscataqua
to make the Lower Plantation one of importance.
Edward Hilton yet held what was called
the Upper Plantation at Dover.</p>

<p>One morning, early in the summer of 1628, the
Mason settlers were disturbed to find that John,
the cook, had disappeared. Whether the days had
become too monotonous for him and he had gone
in search of adventure, or had been lost by wandering
too far into the woods, no one knew. Finally
Nonowit, who had become fond of Roger and had
spent much time in teaching him the ways of the
woods, was sent with the boy in search of the lost
cook.</p>

<p>The two started in the direction of the Upper
Plantation. Not far from the Hilton Settlement,
the sound of a shot in the woods brought them to
a standstill and then to the ground, where they hid
in the underbrush. Through the clearing they saw
a deer fall. They waited breathlessly, expecting
next to see the bulky form of John shoulder his
game. To their surprise, a Tarateen Indian glided
over the ground to the fallen deer. As he was an
enemy, Nonowit and Roger remained in hiding until
they could safely continue their journey. They then
carried to the plantation not only news of a lost
man, but also the astonishing word that Indians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
were using guns in the woods.</p>

<p>Such a thing was unheard of. It was against the
law of the settlers to trade firearms or ammunition
with the Indians. How it had been done, or by
whom, was a matter that must be looked into at
once. The people of the Upper Plantation had
seen nothing of the cook, though that was of small
moment now.</p>

<p>Edward Hilton felt it was of utmost importance
to return at once with Roger and Nonowit to the
Lower Plantation.</p>

<p>On arriving there, a leader from Naumkeag was
found who had brought the same disastrous word
that the Indians were armed. He had received a
message to the same effect from Weesagascusatt.
It threatened serious danger for the colonists.
Just at dusk a messenger from Winnisimmet arrived
at Piscataqua with the same rumor. By
candle light that night a conference of grave importance
was held. The Naumkeag leader reported
that a man named Morton had opened his
settlement at Mount Wollaston, Mass. to all discontented
servants and lawless people. He had
changed the name to Merrie Mount and there he
allowed reckless, dissolute living. Upon hearing of
the loss of the cook, he suggested that he might be
found among the merrymakers.</p>

<p>Worst of all, Morton had establishe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>d a trade of
firearms with the Indians in order to obtain a greater
number of furs. With guns in such skilled and
treacherous hands, the white settlers stood in great
danger.</p>

<p>The discussion that night resulted in an agreement
to send letters, pleading for help, to Plymouth,
which, though it stood in less danger, was a colony
stronger than all the rest together. It was also near
enough for an approach to Morton at Merrie Mount.</p>

<p>Roger was asked to carry the letters. With
Nonowit as his guide, he started out on the following
day. It was an adventurous trip, partly by land
and partly by sea, for the man from Naumkeag was
returning by water and carried the two along with
him.</p>

<p>When well underway by boat, a darkened sky and
wild wind drove the small vessel to the Isle of Shoals
for shelter, where they found at anchor "The
Whale," an English ship soon to cross the ocean.
The hurricane was of short duration, and the messengers
continued their journey.</p>

<p>Traveling afoot from Naumkeag, they soon
noticed fresh footprints on the path, which suggested
that someone was not far ahead of them.
They continued with increased haste and added
caution. Nonowit suddenly gave the signal for
silence when, not far from the path, they saw
through the thicket the broad shoulders of a white
man eating by his camp fire. They remained silent
until he turned and the jolly face of J<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>ohn was visible.
He was doubtless on his way to Merrie Mount
but allowed them to think he was merely off for
a change. On learning what had happened and the
message they carried, John allied himself to the
two and begged to continue with them.</p>

<p>After a rough journey, the three arrived at Plymouth
and delivered the letters, which were most
carefully considered by the men of that colony.
Realizing the serious danger such a center as Merrie
Mount could be to all the settlements, it was decided
to send a note of warning to Morton. He, however,
treated it with scorn and in the same spirit rejected
a second appeal. Then, with stern determination
to take the man by force, Captain Miles
Standish started with his company of soldiers. He
returned with Morton, who was sent as a prisoner to
England on "The Whale," the very ship the travelers
had found about to sail from the Isles of Shoals.
The various colonies shared the expense.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Roger, Nonowit, and John finally arrived home,
triumphant with the news of success. But the
wrong Morton had already done the settlers was
never rectified, for the Indians had learned the value
and power of a gun and never again were content
without firearms.</p>

<h2><a name="STRAWBERRY_BANK" id="STRAWBERRY_BANK"></a>STRAWBERRY BANK.</h2>

<p>"Couldn't he find one anywhere, Mother?" asked
Samuel.</p>

<p>"Why didn't he keep on looking?" persisted
Richard, as the two boys braced themselves for the
lurch of the vessel which was tossing on a choppy
sea. Mrs. Chadborn steadied herself and continued
the story they so loved.</p>

<p>"It was almost thirty years ago that Martin
Pring sailed up the river to which we are now
going. He searched the forests on either bank for
a certain tree which he believed had the power to
give people health and happiness. He found the
deserted camp fires of the Indians, but, even though
no savages disturbed his hunt, he sailed away disappointed
because he could not find a sassafras
tree."</p>

<p>"I believe I could find one there," boasted Richard,
with a secret determination to do so, "for I know
how they look."</p>

<p>This was in the early summer of 1631. It was
a happy day when they landed on the New England
shore close by the Mason Manor House, which had
been built eight years before. Then it was the only
one for many miles. Now some eighty men and
women of many trades had come to settle about
it and to build another which they would call the
Great House.</p>

<p>There was much to interest Samuel and Richard
in the salt works and the flakes where fish were
dried, and in the fort which was built on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> hillock
between the Manor-house and the ocean.</p>

<p>But a few days after landing, Richard, much
troubled, hunted for Samuel, whom he found fishing
from the rocks.</p>

<p>"Sam, Mother's almost sick. Father says the
voyage has tired her. He thinks she's homesick,
too. What can we do about it?"</p>

<p>Samuel dropped his pole and sighed, "I wish we
could find a sassafras tree."</p>

<p>"We will," cried Richard, jumping to his feet.
"Father will let us go with him to the place where
they are working on the Great House. It is several
miles away, but we can hunt the woods there and
camp with the men until they come back."</p>

<p>Mr. Chadborn readily consented, not knowing
what plan the boys had in mind. But he warned
them not to stray far, for, once lost, they were at
the mercy of the Indians and the wild beasts.</p>

<p>They made a long search always keeping within
the sound of hammers.</p>

<p>"I'll keep the path while you examine that tree
off there," they constantly agreed, but never did they
find one of the right kind. For two days they
searched diligently, glad to get back to the cornmeal
cakes and pea-porridge, and at night, quite
as disappointed as Pring and doubtless more tired,
they fell upon the bed of boughs their father had
laid for them.</p>

<p>On the third morning Mr. Chadborn told them to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
keep within call, for they were to return to the
Manor that day.</p>

<p>Samuel thought quite seriously, while Richard
lay on the ground discouraged.</p>

<p>"What is it, Sam?" cried Richard, catching a
gleam in his brother's eye, and ready always to grasp
at a suggestion.</p>

<p>"Let's make baskets out of bark from a birch tree
and fill them with these strawberries for Mother."</p>

<p>They went to work with much energy, surprised
to find how abundantly the berries grew along the
banks, and returned to the Manor so full of the account
of that strawberry patch that their disappointment
was almost forgotten.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother, see what we have found! The bank
was covered with berries, even after we had picked
all these!"</p>

<p>"Why, boys, it is just like the home-land! Surely
Captain John Smith had described this Place well
for Prince Charles to name it New England. Already
I feel better, for this land is not so strange
since home things grow here."</p>

<p>The boys found that even the sassafras could not
have given her more pleasure. They went to bed
that night before dark, contented with their search
and anxious to return to the strawberry field.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>For twenty years the land about the Great House
was called Strawberry Bank. Though that was almost
three hundred years ago and the name was
afterward changed to Portsmouth, there are now
many people in New England, and some outside, who
know just what spot is meant when they hear of
Strawberry Bank.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BOYS_CATCH" id="THE_BOYS_CATCH"></a>THE BOYS' CATCH.</h2>

<p>"Get off that boat! We can't be bothered by boys
on this trip!"</p>

<p>Edward Godfrie, who had charge of the fisheries
at Mason Manor, shouted with stern authority.</p>

<p>It was scarcely daybreak on a May morning in
1632. Six great shallops lay at anchor off the rocks.
Five fishing boats were in readiness, while several
skiffs were conveying fishermen and equipment for
the day's work.</p>

<p>Godfrie's own boy, Hugh, and James Williams,
regretfully climbed ashore.</p>

<p>"Leave that seine behind!" was the next order to
the boatmen. The stretch of net was pitched out
upon the rocks.</p>

<p>Every available worker at the Manor was ready
to cast a line or haul a net on this trip, for the biggest
catch possible was to be made that day. The Warwick,
an English trading vessel of the Laconia Company,
had already gone up the Piscataqua River and
on her return would take a cargo of fish back to
England. No later catch could be sufficiently salted
and dried.</p>

<p>"To feed eighty people every day," grumbled
Godfrie, "and keep a cargo on hand, can't be done
even in these waters."</p>

<p>There had been little planting on this shore; so
the fish already prepared for market had been eaten
by the hungry settlers because of the delayed arrival
of the Warwick with food supplies. Perhaps this
accounts for Godfrie's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> irritation and anxiety for a
good catch. When the last boat had started, he
stepped into a skiff, picked up the oars, and pulled
for the fishing fleet.</p>

<p>Four forlorn boys, for Samuel and Richard Chadborn
had joined the others, stood on the shore and
watched the sails against the pink of the morning
sky. The glorious air and strong salt breeze made
the land seem unbearable to them. They wandered
to the flakes and on to the salt works. Francis
Williams, James's father, manufactured the salt.</p>

<p>"Get away from there, boys," he shouted, as they
appeared. "A big catch comes in tonight, and we
need every grain!"</p>

<p>Log cabins were scattered about the estate for
those who did not live in the Hall. Horses, cows,
pigs, sheep, and goats had their sheds or wandered
about at will. However, there was no interest in
them for the boys, who sauntered back to the shore
from which the boats had started.</p>

<p>"There are two skiffs left," suggested Hugh.
"Let's go fishing for ourselves!"</p>

<p>"Yes!" exclaimed Sam, with a new idea. "And
why not take that net and stretch it across the
narrows in the little harbor? I saw the men do
that one day."</p>

<p>It was a thought that aroused them all, perhaps
because it required both daring and pluck. The net
was a weighty one for their muscles, although t<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>hey
were stout, strong fellows for their years.</p>

<p>James's father felt relieved as he saw them start.
At least the flakes and the salt would be unmolested.
However, his attitude changed at sundown when the
boys had not returned.</p>

<p>The fishing fleet brought back a set of disappointed
men, for the catch had not been what was hoped
for by many pounds. Godfrie's grumbling could
be heard before he landed, nor was it lessened when
he reached shore to find that his boy, with the
others, was missing.</p>

<p>The sun set and the moon rose, yet nothing had
been seen of the boys. An hour later the distant
splash of oars on the quiet waters and excited boy
voices brought all the Manor folk to the shore. The
approach was so slow that there was great fear that
some one had been hurt. Yet there was an elated
tone as the voices came nearer. When they were
within shouting distance there came a call for help.</p>

<p>A half-dozen strong men jumped into their skiffs
and pulled with speed. In a half-hour's time two
great boat-loads of fish were pulled ashore. The
boys had stretched their net at low water across a
narrow part of the stream. As the tide rushed in,
it brought fish in a school of unusual size, which,
caught by the current, had entered the little harbor
instead of the main river.</p>

<p>This catch made up for the loss in the day's fishing.
Men and boys set to work in the moonlight to clea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>n
the fish. They then spread them on the flakes for
salting and drying.</p>

<p>Godfrie started a good cargo to the English markets,
and each of the four boys carried the title
of Captain for weeks to come.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><a name="THE_FOREST_GARDEN" id="THE_FOREST_GARDEN"></a>THE FOREST GARDEN.</h2>

<p>It was the spring of 1633. Richard and Samuel
had watched the distant horizon for many days.
At last came the shout, "A sail! A sail!"</p>

<p>Later, the Warwick dropped anchor. The boys
soon climbed aboard, and there they found Rebecca
Gibbons, an English girl, who had started with her
mother to join her father, Ambrose Gibbons, who
was helping establish the New Hampshire Colony
for the Mason grant. John Mason had given the
name because of his home in Hampshire, England.</p>

<p>"Then you are going on to Newichewannock,"
explained Richard. "Your father has built a house
there for you. At the falls they have a saw-mill.
It is the only one in New England."</p>

<p>Samuel, who had gone ashore, then returned with
a package, which he tucked into Rebecca's hands
with a whisper. She secretly hid this strange parcel
as the vessel started.</p>

<p>The Warwick left its passengers and supplies at
the Great House on Strawberry Bank, and continued
up the winding Piscataqua, which seemed
endlessly long to Rebecca. At last a final turn
brought to sight the new home, and, best of all, her
father, followed by his four helpers, hurrying down
to the shore.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i040.jpg">
<img src="images/i040-th.jpg" width="400" height="486" alt="" title="" /></a>
</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>The house was a substantial one. There were
also a barn, other small buildings, and a fine well,
all surrounded by a palisade which protected the
family from wild animals and hostile Indians.</p>

<p>The saw-mill kept a busy hum on the logs, making
boards for immediate use. Many were also to be
shipped to England on the returning vessel. Ambrose
Gibbons and his men spent their time otherwise:
in search for useful ores or minerals, or
trading for furs to be sent back to the Laconia Company,
who, in turn, kept the colonists supplied from
English stores. Perhaps for these reasons the gardens
were quite neglected, and so Rebecca's strange
little parcel proved a double treasure.</p>

<p>Her spinning done with the spirit of a true pioneer,
Rebecca explored the surrounding woods and
soon knew them quite as well as the nooks and
corners of her own dooryard. In one spot there
grew a thick undergrowth, through which she crept
and discovered a small clearing so closely shut in
that it would never have been suspected.</p>

<p>"This is the spot for my secret," she declared and
began to pull the grass by the roots. The next day
she returned with spade and rake, and her mysterious
package. It was to be a buried treasure, for
here she opened her bundle and planted in various
holes the kernels of yellow Indian corn which
Samuel had given her.</p>

<p>"There!" she exclaimed, as she patted the loose
earth. "This is to be my own secret, till I am quite
ready to tell. Then I will surprise them."</p>

<p>The home people were too much occupied with
their own interests to give attention to Rebecca's
play-time. The Newich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>ewannock Indians, whose
settlement was near by, were camping elsewhere
for the summer, so that no one even guessed the
garden, or knew how well it was growing.</p>

<p>Some struggling grape vines and a few vegetables
had been planted within the palisade, but small attention
had been given to them. In fact, so little
gardening had been done that the Autumn brought
anxious days. No English vessel had come in, nor
had the grain from Virginia arrived in Boston,
where it was to be ground at the wind-mill and sent
on to Strawberry Bank.</p>

<p>The meal-chest at the Newichewannock home was
almost empty, and except for fish and game the
food supply was low. The situation became serious.
Ambrose Gibbons started, one crisp fall morning,
for the Bank, hoping to obtain food of some sort.
He took one man with him, while the other three
with their axes started for a distant point to fell
trees, not returning until night.</p>

<p>Rebecca ran off for awhile that afternoon to inspect
her garden, which was now filled with a surprising
growth of ripening corn.</p>

<p>"It might be picked at once," she whispered to
herself. "But I think I will leave it for a big surprise.
Father may not be able to get us food."</p>

<p>Quite elated over her splendid crop, she hastened
back to the house. She was surprised to find the
gate of the palisade ope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>n and still more astonished
to see a tall figure in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Her frightened mother was showing the empty
meal-chest to a fierce looking Indian. Rebecca
did not then know it was Rowls, the Sagamore of
the Newichewannock Camp. He had returned
ahead of his people with a small but hungry band
of Indians.</p>

<p>"He has come for food, dearie, but I cannot make
him understand that we have nothing."</p>

<p>Rowls straightened himself and by motions again
ordered Mrs. Gibbons to get him food. At the same
time he showed a fine beaver skin for exchange.
Empty cupboards and barrels were opened, but the
fierce creature believed the food was hidden and
raised his knife as a threat. At this a sudden
thought struck Rebecca. With energy she motioned
for him to wait. Then she darted to her secret
garden, where she tore the precious ears from the
stalks until her arms were full. Fearing for her
mother in the meantime, she flew back to the house
to find that Rowls had patiently waited.</p>

<p>It was what he wanted. With a satisfied grunt,
he took the corn and presented Rebecca with the
most beautiful beaver skin she had ever seen. After
the Sagamore had gone and the palisade gate
was bolted, Rebecca explained her secret garden to
her surprised mother.</p>

<p>She then for the first time realized the disappointment
of not bringing in her own crop, should her
father return without food. But just then a whi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>stle
was heard outside the gate, and Ambrose Gibbons
was admitted, bowed over with a heavy sack of
grain, for the Virginia supply had that morning
reached Strawberry Bank.</p>

<p>Soon after these events a grist-mill was established
at Newichewannock, and gardens became a matter
of more careful consideration.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FUR_TRADE" id="THE_FUR_TRADE"></a>THE FUR TRADE</h2>

<p>The winter had passed since Rebecca Gibbons had
traded her corn crop for a beaver skin. That piece
of fur had become a much-beloved treasure to
Becky. It covered her rag dolls in the daytime and
served her as a blanket many a cold night.</p>

<p>The winter had been a rough one, filled with severe
hardships. In spite of their knowledge of New
England winters, even the Indians in their encampment
close at hand suffered. Hostile tribes had
at times surrounded the house a hundred strong.
Added to these troubles there was a great
scarcity of provisions, so that a longing for warmer
days was coupled with an anxious hope for the returning
English vessel. Supplies of all kinds were
sadly needed.</p>

<p>One cold raw day in May, Rebecca wandered into
the woods to gather early spring flowers. She suddenly
realized that, in spite of her usual care, she
had strayed beyond the sound of the buzzing mill.
Searching in vain for a familiar spot, she at last
shouted for help. No sound was heard in reply.
She dropped to the ground, frightened by the
thought of the many awful things that might happen.
Was that a shadow at her feet? She started
suddenly to find standing behind her a silent Indian
squaw, with a pappoose strapped to her back.
Without a word the woman turned and Rebecca
followed, for she had recognized a squaw of the
neighboring camp. It was a long walk home. As
they passed the Newichewannock Camp, four forlorn
shivering little Indians who had been huddling
over the dying coals caught her attention.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>
<p>Rebecca was stirred by the misery of their cold
and hunger, quite forgetting how near her own
household were to this same misery. On reaching
home, determined to show her thanks for this safe
return, the little girl hunted out her fishing pole
and started for the river. She hoped to make a
catch for these hungry people. She reached the
rocks and cast her line like a true fisherman.</p>

<p>"Captain Neal will feel mean enough when he gets
here and finds us all starved to death," she murmured
as she jerked her pole only to find her line had
caught and broken. Finally, with the disappointment
of no fish, she was turning toward the house
when a white gleam on the water caught her eye.
It was from the sail of the Pide-Cowe, the English
vessel just rounding the bend.</p>

<p>Rebecca dashed home with the news. That afternoon
cornmeal, salt, beef, butter, sweet oil, oatmeal,
and candles were landed within the palisade.
There were men's coats, waistcoats, and children's
coats, stockings, blankets, rugs, flannel and cotton
cloth, as well as fish hooks and lines, lead, hammers,
pewter dishes, and iron kettles.</p>

<p>Indians, gay in fringes and beads, arrived on the
scene with loads of fur: otter, mink, fox, and beaver
for trade. Ragged squaws and shivering pappooses
followed. Captain Neal and his sailors mingled
with hearty good cheer among them, while the white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
settlers acted as tradesmen, happy in the relief
which this vessel had brought them.</p>

<p>Rebecca was wild with excitement. She knew
this meant food for everybody. Each box and barrel
was turned and inspected by Miss Becky. She
poked over the piles of clothing and tried on the
children's coats and even the men's coats, anything
in fact that struck her fancy. Some bright beaded
things caught her eye. Pulling at the English
shag, she drew from the bottom of a pile a queer
little garment labeled "Pappoose coat." After
searching and tugging, she produced five of different
sizes. Then her eye fell on the group of timid
little creatures still clinging to their mother.</p>

<p>Rebecca knew that at this trading all the furs
would go to buy food. Her wise little head thought,
"These coats would make them so comfortable!"
Perched on a salt-cask close to the pile she was soon
absorbed in her own plans, which were quickly completed.
Jumping down she excitedly ran to explain
them to her mother, who had been watching the
trading from the doorway of their home. Becky
stood on tip-toe, awaiting her mother's decision.
After a moment's thought, it came. The child rushed
indoors and soon returned with her still beautiful
beaver-skin.</p>

<p>"Captain Neal," she cried, before she had fairly
reached him. "How many of these pappoose coats
will you trade for this beaver?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"You may have all for such a skin as that," he
exclaimed as he stroked the soft fur.</p>

<p>With the five coats in her own possession, proud
little Becky begged her mother's help. Together
they fitted them to the five smallest Indian children.
Trading ceased for a moment, while all eyes turned
to the funny sight of these wild little creatures in
English clothing. The settlers and seamen laughed
aloud, while even the stolid faces of the old warriors
looked pleased.</p>

<h2><a name="COATS_SHIRTS_AND_KETTLES" id="COATS_SHIRTS_AND_KETTLES"></a>COATS, SHIRTS, AND KETTLES.</h2>

<p>During the winter of 1637-8, at least three feet of
snow remained on the ground from November 4th
until March 5th. Broken ice was still in the rivers,
when in March a coaster started from Boston with
Mrs. Wheelwright and her five children and also
friends of hers with their children.</p>

<p>Little Thomas, quite as round as the small iron
kettle which he carried under his plump arm,
trudged up the plank to the deck.</p>

<p>"Mother, see what Tom has!" exclaimed Susan
with some disgust.</p>

<p>"Never mind, child," came the tired reply. "That
kettle was forgotten in packing, and, if it pleases
him, do let him keep it."</p>

<p>There were children enough on board to make
the party a merry one in spite of the sharp cold
winds. The vessel turned northward, rounded the
coast to the Piscataqua River, and pushed its way
among the ice chunks even into Great Bay, not
stopping until it came to the foot of the falls in
Squamscot River.</p>

<p>The Rev. John Wheelwright and several of his
followers had already spent the winter about Piscataqua.
The rough cabins, now built for their
families, were not so comfortable nor so well furnished
as the home Rebecca Gibbons had found at
Newichewannock.</p>

<p>The children were delighted with the wild woods.
The month gave them some warm spring-like days,
and they soon established a play camp for themselves
not far from the cabins. Edward and J<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>oseph
built a wigwam pointed at the top like those of the
Squamscot Indians who camped along the river.</p>

<p>"Look," cried Susan with delight as she rested
three poles together at the top, "this will stand over
our fire, and we can swing Tom's kettle from it."</p>

<p>But Tom and the kettle were missing. At last he
was found in the curled roots of an old oak, scratching
the picture of an Indian on the rough surface
of his treasured kettle, which he was persuaded to
use for the new play. The fun went with zest until
Susan was called into the house.</p>

<p>"There, dear," explained her mother, passing her
an armful of woolen stuff, "you must take my needle
and finish this seam, while I prepare these birds for
a stew. This is the last of six shirts your father
wished completed soon."</p>

<p>Susan seated herself by the fireside on a stool,
which was merely a tree stump, for their furniture
was of the roughest kind. Her mother quickly
plucked the feathers from the wild fowl that had
just been brought in and prepared them for the
kettle that hung on the crane over the hearth fire.</p>

<p>"Oh, may we have that little one, Mother, for our
camp?" begged Susan. "We want to make a stew
out there in Tom's kettle."</p>

<p>Her mother consented and laid the bird aside,
while Susan watched carefully to see just how the
stew was made. When it began to boil, her mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
picked up the sewing and told her to run and play
again.</p>

<p>The children soon had a fire crackling and the
fowl stewing. They sat delightedly about it, planning
many fine uses for the little black kettle with
its three short legs. Then Edward and Joseph
started on a scouting trip, but returned later with
eyes that told of something more real than play.</p>

<p>"We've found an Indian boy, a real one, Susan,
lying on the ground as if he were sick."</p>

<p>"Then," replied Susan quickly, "take him some of
our broth. I am sure it will help him. There it is,
just as good as mother's," she exclaimed, as she gave
a final taste and poured out a bowlful.</p>

<p>Some half dozen children followed the boys and
soon circled about a frightened Indian lad stretched
on the ground. In a trice, Susan had propped him
up and was feeding him with the stew, which seemed
to revive him. Soon he allowed the children to
lead him back to their wigwam, where he dropped
again to the ground. They brought him food from
the house, and then to amuse him they showed their
black kettle and pointed out the Indian Tom had
scratched on its side. Though the lad said nothing,
his fear was gone, and his eyes were wide with
interest. Suddenly a shadow fell across the path,
and the little Indian's face brightened. There stood
a full-grown Indian of the Piscataqua tribe. It was
Nonowit, though these children did not know him.
The little fellow was his son, Assacon, who had lost
his father on this hunting trip and had become <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>exhausted
for want of food.</p>

<p>Not only Nonowit, but other Indians began to arrive
at the new settlement. White men landed on
the shore with loads of woolen shirts and heavy
coats like those sent on the English vessels; even
iron kettles were lifted from their boats.</p>

<p>The next day, which was April 3rd, 1638, Wehanownowit,
Sagamore of the Piscataquas, Pummadockyon,
his son, and Aspamabough arrived with
many of their tribe. The Squamscot Indians and
others gathered together with the white men in
their clearing by the river.</p>

<p>The questioning children begged of their fathers
to know what it all meant. They were told that, as
the men of the Plymouth colony had thought it just
and kind to pay the Indians for the use of their
lands, so Mr. Wheelright had urged the men of the
New Hampshire settlement to do the same.</p>

<p>A deed was made out to the Indians, promising
the land of a certain district for settlement by the
white men, but reserving the privilege for the
Indians to hunt and fish there. Payment was to be
made in money as well as coats, shirts, and kettles.
The white men signed their names, but the Indians
could not write. The children then saw Wehanownowit
with the point of a wild goose quill make his
mark of a man holding a tomahawk. Pummadockyon
drew a man with a bow and arrow, and Aspamabough,
who also signed the deed, drew for his mark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
an arrow and bow. And thus a friendly feeling
was established between the natives and the colonists
at the time of this settlement, which grew to be
the town of Exeter, named for the one in England.</p>

<p>When the coats, the shirts, and the kettles of
varying sizes were shouldered, the Indians started
homeward. The children then hurried back to their
camp and soon found that their own play-kettle
was gone. After many inquiries it was learned that
in the confusion of things someone had caught it
up and tossed it upon the pile of kettles offered to
the Indians. The children were bitterly disappointed
and sorely missed the loved plaything. Nor could
another be spared from the limited home supply.</p>

<p>Weeks went by, and the children still played in
their camp. One day, while all were gone on a play-search
for food, Joseph was left on guard in a hollow
tree with merely a peep-hole through which to
watch. He heard the cracking of a twig; to his surprise,
something moved cautiously through the
bushes. It was a real Indian boy. He crept to the
wigwam door, peeped in, and then thrust in his arm.
Joseph could not tell whether it was to take or to
leave something. As the lad turned, he proved to be
Assacon. Before Joseph could scramble from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
tree, the Indian was gone, frightened perhaps by
the voices of the returning children. Together they
hurried to the wigwam, and there in the center stood
the little black kettle with the same picture that Tom
had scratched upon it. Assacon had found it in his
own camp. In some way he had secured it and, in
appreciation of their goodness to him, had traveled
some ten miles to return it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="WINNICUNNET" id="WINNICUNNET"></a>WINNICUNNET.</h2>

<p>In the days when no lines were drawn between
Massachusetts and New Hampshire, the General
Court of Massachusetts had an eye open for a
stretch of salt-marsh a few miles north of the Merrimac
River, near the sea. The forests were so thick
that feeding places for the cattle were difficult to
find. Here on these marshes salt was added to the
food, which in those days was considered a most
valuable possession. For that reason it was agreed
that three men from Newbury and Ipswich should
build a house on the edge of the marsh.</p>

<p>So on an October day in 1638 they went in a shallop
up the winding Winnicunnet River. Where Hampton
now stands, they built of logs the Bound House,
to make good the claim of Massachusetts to the
marsh.</p>

<p>Soon others followed, and the little settlement
of Winnicunnet grew up in the wilderness, miles
from other neighbors, except the Indians who had
pitched their wigwams in the vicinity. Their trails
along the river and over the marshes to the sea were
used by the white men in hunting and fishing.</p>

<p>In this same wilderness Elizabeth dwelt in a cabin
of logs, yet not without playmates or playthings.
Chewannick, an Indian boy who lived in a wigwam,
came often to play with her, and the little black lamb
that was born in the spring was given to Elizabeth
for her very own. As soon as she found it was hers,
she called Chewannick within the palisade to see the
little black thing with legs like sticks.</p>

<p>"When it is old enough to be sheared," she explained,
"I shall help to do that myself. Then my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
mother will help me to card its nice black wool, and
we will spin it into long threads. I shall then weave
a thick cloth, which will make me a warm winter
cloak."</p>

<p>Chewannick stood with wide-open eyes understanding
by Elizabeth's motions much of what she
was telling him. Together they made the little creature
a comfortable bed in the big yard outside the
cabin.</p>

<p>It was most necessary to have the high fence built
about the house to protect the garden from foxes
and other prowling creatures, and to keep the wolves
and the bears away from the cattle and sheep at
night. Through the day, the gate stood open. The
cows and sheep wandered off to the marsh grass,
and the children came and went as they wished, but
before the sun went down, every creature was driven
home, and the children were safely inside when
the gate was barred. When Elizabeth petted her
little black lamb at night, she could hear the howl
of the wolves through the woods and often the growl
of a bear just outside the enclosure.</p>

<p>One day when the children were outside the palisade,
Chewannick attempted to climb it. Elizabeth
laughed and declared he could not do it. He then
fastened a prop between the closely planted posts
and tried again, but he could not spring with enough
force to get over. Again and again on succeeding
days he tried, determined at every fa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>ilure to reach
the top some day.</p>

<p>Late one afternoon as the cows came wandering
in at their usual hour, the children watched the
sheep huddle together. Elizabeth noticed that the
little black lamb was not with them.</p>

<p>"And the sheep came from the woods, not the
marsh," she added after her first word of surprise.</p>

<p>"Come, Chewannick, we must find my lamb!"</p>

<p>Unnoticed by her mother, who was busy in the
yard, Elizabeth led the Indian boy over the well
trodden path to the woods. Already the sun had
dropped, but on and on the children went until they
paused to listen. From the far-distance came a
faint cry like that of a child.</p>

<p>"It is my precious, black woolly lamb!" cried
Elizabeth, frantically. "It is in the thorn bushes!"</p>

<p>Farther still they pushed into the woods, hardly
noticing how dark the shadows were growing.
The cry seemed close at hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, here's my darling lamb!" Elizabeth tugged
at the poor little thing, caught by its woolly
fleece in the long sharp thorns of a bush.</p>

<p>"Help, Chewannick, pull hard!"</p>

<p>Great tufts of black wool were left on the bush,
but the frightened little creature was freed at last.</p>

<p>The woods seemed very dark by that time, as
they half pulled, half carried the lamb ho<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>meward.
Darker still it grew. Howls could be heard in the
distance. The children hurried on. Suddenly a
wolf barked on their very trail. They were then
within sight of the house, but with horror they saw
that the gate was closed. The hastening wolf had
caught the scent of the lamb. The children tried to
shout, but they could make no sound.</p>

<p>Chewannick bounded ahead. With desperate
force he sprang upon the fence, grasped the top, and
fairly fell over the other side. He had the door unbarred
for Elizabeth and the lamb, as the fiery eyes
of the wolf could be seen but a few rods up the
path. The gate was closed in time to shut the
creature out, while Elizabeth's surprised mother
caught up her little girl as if she feared the wolf
might even then spring through the bolted door.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CRYSTAL_HILLS" id="THE_CRYSTAL_HILLS"></a>THE CRYSTAL HILLS.</h2>

<p>Those who sailed the sea came always to these
shores with accounts of the white and shining hills
seen far back over the land. From other travelers
were gathered wonderful tales of lakes stocked with
delicate fish, fine forests rich in game, and fair valleys
abounding in fruits, nuts, and vines.</p>

<p>The immediate needs of the settlements held most
of the colonists close to their homes, but the spirit
of adventure was too strong for Darby Field. It
was soon reported among the few households of
Exeter that he was going to explore the country to
the North, an enterprise which was of great interest
to them all. He hoped to find gold and precious
stones added to all the other wonders. It was
thought that a trip of a hundred miles might take
him to the river of Canada, or perhaps to the Great
Lakes.</p>

<p>Susan, Edward, Joseph, and all the other children
stood about with wide-eyed wonder at the courage
and daring that could carry one so far into an unknown
wilderness. With two Indians as companions,
and a pack strapped to his back, Darby
Field waved his good-bye to the group of settlers and
started off.</p>

<p>For some forty miles they traveled past lakes
large and small, over Indian trails, and through
pathless forests. From this time on they seemed to
be tramping upward. Field felt sure that they had
reached the lower slopes of the shining hills so often
seen from the sea.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>At last they climbed to a moss-grown level. Here
they found an encampment of some two hundred
Indians, who proved to be friendly. The travelers
rested and looked about. Not far away appeared
<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
"a rude heap of massive stones, piled upon one
another a mile high, on which one might ascend
from stone to stone, like a pair of winding stairs."</p>

<p>Darby Field was moved by the charm of that peak
which seemed to be the highest of all. When he expressed
a determination to climb to the top, the Indians,
horrified at the thought, begged him for his
life to refrain. It was, they assured him, Agiochook,
the abode of the Great Spirit whom they
could see in the clouds about the summit. His voice
could be heard in the thunder of the storms from
cliff to cliff. The winds were manifestations of His
power. His gentleness was revealed through the sunset
colors that lingered on the slopes. This sacred
mountain had never been climbed by an Indian.
Now they begged the white man not to risk his life.</p>

<p>In spite of this warning, Darby Field persisted in
his plan. A group of Indians accompanied him to
within eight miles of the top. There they waited
for his return, for this daring act was of great concern
to them. The two Indians who had followed
Field from home took courage by his example and
held to the party, which was undoubtedly the first
that ever climbed our Mount Washington.</p>

<p>From the summit they saw waters to the westward,
which they thought to be the great lake from
which the Canada river flows. To the North, the
country was said to be <a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
"daunting terrible, full
of rocky hills as thick as mole hills in a meadow, and
clothed with infinite thick woods." Perhaps the
outlook was too terrible for adventure, for aft<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>er
they had picked up clear shining stones which
proved to be crystals, they descended the mountain
and presented themselves safe to the waiting Indians.
Then instead of continuing their explorations,
they decided to return home.</p>

<p>After an absence of eighteen days, they reached
home. On a cold night in June of 1642, the grown
folk and children gathered about a blazing hearth
to hear of the country that lay to the North.</p>

<p>The travelers reported a wonderful trip of at
least a hundred miles from home. They felt sure
that their discovery of the Great Lakes
<a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>"wanted
but one day's journey of being finished," but for lack
of sufficient provisions they had been obliged to return.
The glistening stones were passed on to the
wondering children, and Field announced that he
had gone as far as the Crystal Hills,&mdash;the name at
one time of the White Mountains of New Hampshire.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DENMARK_CATTLE" id="THE_DENMARK_CATTLE"></a>THE DENMARK CATTLE.</h2>

<p>The thread dropped from the spinning wheel as
Elizabeth earnestly leaned forward in the firelight,
that late afternoon of May in 1643.</p>

<p>"Uncle Richard, is there any school for boys&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh! here comes your father!" whispered her
uncle.</p>

<p>Francis Norton, absorbed in thought, entered the
large east room of Mason Manor house and wandered
to the window, where he scanned the ocean distance
for a sail. Elizabeth silently picked up her
thread.</p>

<p>"Things have become serious, Richard," exclaimed
Norton. "Since Mason's death, few supplies
have come from England, as you know, and the
amounts due the workers here have long been unpaid.
I am here to manage the Mason affairs and
consequently get the blame, yet my own interests
are at stake. My boy must be educated&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Father, six cows are missing!" It
was a rugged, healthy boy who burst into the room.
"They have wandered off somewhere, and now it's
milking time. Shall I hunt them up?"</p>

<p>Norton continued his conversation, quite ignoring
his son, who respectfully awaited his father's
reply.</p>

<p>"There is a school at Cambridge, near Boston.
The only one I know of in New England. A
Charlestown minister, John Harvard, left eight
hundred pounds for it a few years ago&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't lose those cows, Francis," interrupted his
brother-in-law. "They are a valuable lot, a Denmark
breed sent over by Mason, while I was a boy."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>Jacob then caught a nod of assent from his father
and cast a quick glance at his sister, Elizabeth, whose
wheel was again whirring busily. She jumped to
her feet.</p>

<p>"May I go too, father?" she cried.</p>

<p>He gave his consent absent-mindedly and then
turned to the subject in question.</p>

<p>Meantime the girl and boy chased off together.</p>

<p>"I believe the cows have wandered through the
woods to the salt-marsh," declared Elizabeth; so
they turned in that direction, following a crooked
path for a long time. At last a breaking of the
bushes opened a way to the discovery of five of the
cows. The children were pushing on for the sixth,
when a distant shout was heard on the opposite
shore of the marshy stream. There in the mud and
mire stood a horse and rider. Each step plunged
them deeper and brought them nearer to the stream.</p>

<p>"Is this the ford?" the stranger called.</p>

<p>Jacob at once saw he had mistaken a cow-path for
a trail.</p>

<p>"Back, quick!" cried the frightened children.
"You cannot cross there!"</p>

<p>The horse, about to plunge again, turned suddenly,
while the children shouted the direction to the ford,
much farther up the stream.</p>

<p>The last cow had by that time appeared. Driving
the six <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>ahead, Jacob and Elizabeth wondered
together who the strange rider might be, and then
turned their discussion to family affairs which kept
the home atmosphere constantly clouded.</p>

<p>"Elizabeth, I must find some way to go to school,"
declared Jacob, "but I know father cannot send me
now. They say all the furs, lumber, and fish that
have been sent from here to England cannot cover
the expense of these people. What can be done?"</p>

<p>"We must find a way, Jacob," replied Elizabeth
thoughtfully, "for you to go to that Cambridge
school called Harvard College. All boys ought to be
educated." She gave no thought to herself, for in
those days girls were taught only home interests.</p>

<p>Still deep in conversation, the children reached
home to find that the same stranger, caught so dangerously
on the marshes, had arrived at the Manor.
He brought Francis Norton a written message,
which had come by way of Boston from a newly-arrived
English ship.</p>

<p>Norton, standing at the door while the rider
waited, read the word and exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"So we're to shift for ourselves! The owners of
the Mason property can no longer be responsible
for their New Hampshire estate."</p>

<p>Many settlers who had come for the purpose of
furthering the interests of this estate were involved
in this crisis. With no returns from England and
back dues long unpaid, the situation seemed hard
and serious. Some of the occupants cl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>aimed the
land they lived upon; some the creatures they cared
for; but the most daring of all was the plan of
Francis Norton.</p>

<p>Jacob heard it first and hurried the astonishing
news to Elizabeth, whom he found at the well.</p>

<p>"Beth, father is going to drive a hundred oxen to
Boston, almost sixty miles! He is to sell them there!
What is more, we are all to go with him!"</p>

<p>This crafty plan was actually carried out. It was
a long, slow journey, but successfully made. The
cattle sold in Boston at twenty pounds sterling a
head, the current price of that day, which brought
Norton a snug little sum. He did not return to
Strawberry Bank, but established a home in Charlestown.
He was then able to give Jacob an education.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CUT_OF_THE_HAIR" id="THE_CUT_OF_THE_HAIR"></a>THE CUT OF THE HAIR.</h2>

<p>So many settlers had come to New Hampshire
that, as early as 1641, the need of a government was
felt, and therefore Massachusetts was asked to extend
her law to this colony. It was then arranged
for two deputies to represent New Hampshire life
in the General Court of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>On a summer's day in 1649, at the boat-landing not
far from the Great House, the power of this General
Court was under discussion by Jonathan Low and
Thomas Berry, as they threw their lines into the
river and waited for the fish to bite.</p>

<p>"The Court can make a man do anything!" remarked
Jonathan. Thomas seemed to doubt it.</p>

<p>"My father has told me," continued Jonathan,
"that not more than four years ago Mr. Williams
bought an African slave from Captain Smith. The
General Court considered it wrong for a man to own
a slave and made Mr. Williams give him up. Then
they sent the black man home to Africa."</p>

<p>"Hush, here comes Mr. Williams now! Who is
that with him?"</p>

<p>"That," replied Jonathan, "is Ambrose Gibbons.
They are both magistrates."</p>

<p>Evidently the men were talking on the same subject
that was interesting the boys, for, as Ambrose
Gibbons stepped into his boat, he remarked emphatically,
"The Court has the power to control this
evil. Hugh Peters returned to England a few years
ago and announced before Parliament that he had
not seen a drunken man, nor heard a profane oath
during the six years he had spent in the colonies. We
can surely then control this ungodly habit that
is threatening to corrupt us."</p>

<p>The boys were alert to find out what the evil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
might be.</p>

<p>"As magistrates," replied Williams, "we control
undue pride and levity of behavior. We oblige the
women to wear their sleeves to their wrists and
close their gowns about their throats. Our men
must now overcome this sinful habit of wearing the
hair long."</p>

<p>Gibbons picked up his oars, remarking, "We will
enforce the law after we have met the governor and
deputies, as is planned." He pushed off his boat, and
Williams walked thoughtfully away, while the boys
agreed that the Court was a power.</p>

<p>For several days the matter remained in Jonathan's
mind. He noticed as never before the trig
little cuffs about his mother's wrists, and the narrow
collar that enclosed her throat. He was so troubled
by the long hair that swept his father's shoulders
that, at last, one afternoon he talked the matter over
with his mother as she sat by the open door. They
both knew Roger Low to be a determined man and
slow to accept new customs.</p>

<p>Little Mary was playing with her dolls under
the spreading lilac bushes. She glanced at the two
as they talked earnestly together and caught bits of
the conversation, but continued with her play.
After an early tea Jonathan and his mother wandered
down by the river, while Roger Low, the father,
weary with a hard day's work, settled himself in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>his
big chair and soon dropped to sleep.</p>

<p>Little Mary had put her dolls to bed and, feeling
much alone, snuggled close to her sleeping father.
Looking at the long locks as they hung from his
bent head, she recalled the afternoon's conversation.</p>

<p>"His hair is too long," she thought. "Jonathan
says it is not right to wear long hair."</p>

<p>Stepping to the shelf she took down the scissors
and quickly gave a delicious snip to her father's thick
locks. Another snip-snap and more hair fell. The
sleeping man roused a little, but finding only his
little Mary playing about him, nodded off again.
His head this time fell in a more favorable position
for Mary to continue the clipping, which she did
most thoroughly.</p>

<p>It was dark when her mother returned and passed
her sleeping husband to put Mary to bed.</p>

<p>Just what happened in that home the next day I
cannot tell you, but Roger Low appeared to the
towns-people with closely cut hair, an astonishing
example, just as the proclamation of the magistrates
was announced.</p>

<p>It read as follows:</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>"For as much as the wearing of long hair,
after the manner of ruffians and barbarous Indians,
has begun to invade New England, we, the magistrates
do declare and manifest our dislike and detestation
against the wearing of such long hair, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
against a thing uncivil, and unmanly, whereby men
do deform themselves and do corrupt good manners.
We do, therefore, earnestly entreat all elders of this
jurisdiction to manifest their zeal against it, that
such as shall prove obstinate and will not reform
themselves, may have God and man to witness
against them."</p>

<h2><a name="CYNTHIAS_BEAR" id="CYNTHIAS_BEAR"></a>CYNTHIA'S BEAR</h2>

<p>"Yes, we have given up the name of Strawberry
Bank," exclaimed Richard Chadborn, as he settled
back before the bright firelight on a sharp October
evening in 1653. His brother Samuel had just returned
from his clearing in Rhode Island, and was
eager to know all that had happened in the years
of absence.</p>

<p>"The townsmen petitioned the General Court of
Massachusetts," Richard continued, "to change the
name to Portsmouth, 'it being the river's mouth and
good as any in the land'."</p>

<p>But the name of Strawberry Bank had caught the
ears of Hannah and small Sam, who rushed to the
spot begging for the story of the first berries picked
there by these very men when they were boys.</p>

<p>Uncle Samuel pulled the two children to his knees,
offering instead a true bear story.</p>

<p>"Now, all this happened," he explained, "to my
Cynthia and John, your cousins, way down in Rhode
Island. They had been to the edge of the clearing
and had gathered a basket of fine blackberries for
their mother.</p>

<p>"'Just what I want for a pasty,' she told them,
'and so well picked that I will make you a gingerbread
man for dinner.'</p>

<p>"Their eyes shone like the berries, as their
mother pulled the molasses pitcher from the shelf.
But there was not a drop in it.</p>

<p>"'Our very last,' she reported, as she looked into
the keg in the corner.</p>

<p>"The shine went out of their eyes until Cynthia
suggested that s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>he and John go to the neighbors
and borrow some. Their mother hesitated, for the
children had never been there alone, but those little
things looked so disappointed that she let them go.</p>

<p>"Well, they got there all right, I suppose, and had
the pitcher filled. They started home, probably
talking about their gingerbread dolls, when little
John called out eagerly, 'See the big dog, sister;
he is coming right to us!'</p>

<p>"Cynthia knew that the creature was a bear.
The sight of him so startled her that she jerked
the pitcher and spilled a great spot of molasses on
the ground.</p>

<p>"The bear was very near by that time and ran for
the molasses.</p>

<p>"'Run, Johnny, run!' Cynthia cried, pulling him
on. She stopped a moment later to pour out more
molasses for the hungry bear, who was already
chasing after them.</p>

<p>"'Run, Johnny, run!' she cried again, anxious not
to lose a moment for those little short legs, and so
the two kept on. When the last drop of molasses
was poured out, and Cynthia had dropped the
pitcher for the bear, little John stubbed his toe and
fell just before the turn of the path to the cabin.</p>

<p>"Now it happened," explained Uncle Samuel,
"that a few minutes before this accident word had
reached me that two bears had been seen in the
woods that morning, and I had rushed home to say
that the children must not go out. Before I had
finished speaking, their mother had grabbed the gun
from the wall and had dashed down the path.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tore ahead with my musket. We made the
turn as the bear was bounding away from the well-licked
pitcher after the children.</p>

<p>"They had no gingerbread dolls that day, but
later I brought them home a fine bearskin rug, on
which they now sit for their bedtime stories."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_WITCHES_OF_1656" id="THE_WITCHES_OF_1656"></a>THE WITCHES OF 1656.</h2>

<p>Strawberry Bank had not only taken the name
of Portsmouth, but other changes had also crept in.
In place of logs, houses were built of bricks burned
in the dooryard; or else were constructed of frames
of oak, often with pitched roofs that sloped to the
ground.</p>

<p>It was in such a house as this that Hannah Puddington
lived. Old Buff, her large, yellow cat,
would sometimes run to the ridgepole and from
there watch for the river boats as they returned
with fresh fish.</p>

<p>One April morning Old Buff hungrily followed
little Hannah to the landing, where she went with
her mother to secure a fresh supply of fish to salt
and dry, as well as some to cook at once.</p>

<p>As they returned, Goodman Trimmings stopped
them to tell of the sad condition of his wife. "She
has surely been bewitched by Goody Walford, whom
she met in the woods. When she first came home,
she could not speak. Her breathing troubled her,
but later she complained that her back was as a
flame of fire and her limbs numb with cold. Goody
Walford told her that she would take a long journey
but would never return, and then the witch seemed
to vanish in the shape of a cat. My wife has since
been very ill."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i075.jpg">
<img src="images/i075-th.jpg" width="400" height="484" alt="" title="" /></a>
</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Goodwife Puddington listened with alarm. "How
frightful to find witchcraft on our own shores!
Charlestown and Salem have been so invaded by it.
There even children have been accused." Fearfully
she grasped little Hannah by the hand and
hurried home.</p>

<p>When the fish were well cooked, Mrs. Puddington
laid one temptingly on a hot pewter plate and covered
it.</p>

<p>"There, Hannah, take this to Goodwife Trimmings.
It may tempt her appetite. Yes, little
Jacob may go with you."</p>

<p>Old Buff followed the two children down the
grassy path and through a short stretch of woods
to the neighbor's. As they returned, Hannah saw
a queer looking figure digging roots in the woods.
Her waistcoat and petticoat were red; her old
apron green. She wore a black hat over a white
linen hood tied under her chin. It was Goody Walford.
Friendly Old Bluff darted to her side, while
Hannah seized Jacob's hand and ran for home. Her
haste and fright moved the little fellow to howls and
tears.</p>

<p>"Stop," commanded Hannah, "you must not cry,
for then they will say that I have bewitched you,
and may be they will hang me as they do the Salem
witches."</p>

<p>He caught her meaning, though he did not fully
understand, and manfully gulped back his sobs.</p>

<p>Another fear came. Hannah had seen the old
witch stretch out her hand and stroke the soft,
yellow fur of Old Buff.</p>

<p>"She might have bewitched him," thought the
little girl, "but I'll tell no one."</p>

<p>At noon Hannah's father came in with more
trouble to tell of Goody Walford. Her husband
would not let her feed his cattle for fear she would
bewitch them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>After sunset Goodwife Evans, frightened by the
reports, came to the Puddington house and begged
that she might stay for the night.</p>

<p>"I am followed by a yellowish cat wherever I go.
I am sure 'tis the witch work of Goody Walford.
Oh, don't open that door!" she cried. "It will come
in." She dropped trembling to the settle.</p>

<p>Little Hannah's fright was quite as great in her
secret fear that Old Buff might be the witch-cat.
She gasped when she saw her father take his gun
from the wall.</p>

<p>"We'll put an end to these witch-cats," he declared,
and stalked out.</p>

<p>Hannah held her breath in fear. She heard no
shot, however. At last her father came in and looked
over his gun.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't work," he muttered.</p>

<p>"There is more witchwork going on inside this
house," his wife remarked as she looked over his
shoulder at the gun. "Your new stockings that I
finished last week have holes in them already."</p>

<p>When on the following morning a large hole was
found under the door that led to the shed, the
family blame was directed to Old Buff. He was
without doubt the yellowish cat that had followed
Goodwife Evans. Hannah had not seen her dearly
loved pet since she had left him in the woods the
day before. She feared to have him come home, yet
her heart yearned for Old Buff.</p>

<p>That day it was discovered that much of the homemade
soap stored under the pitch of the roof had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Cat-witchery it surely is!" declared Mrs. Puddington.</p>

<p>Little Hannah, miserably unhappy, tossed in her
bed that night. Perhaps she slept a little. She
was, however, quick to awake upon hearing a cry
at her window. Like a flash she bounded out of bed,
pushed up the sash, and pulled in her own dear Buff.</p>

<p>"You're not bewitched, I know you're not, my
dear Old Buff. You wouldn't cry in that same old
way if you were! Come quick and let me hide you
so you won't get shot!"</p>

<p>She pushed the cat under the bedclothes and in
her happy relief dropped to sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning Old Buff, proud and dignified,
sat like a king before the kitchen fire, while at his
feet lay the body of the huge rat he had killed. It
was the rat that had eaten the stockings, had gnawed
the door, and had carried off the soap, afterward
found in the walls. Old Buff was the hero of the
house.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<p>This strange experience of the Puddington household
was told throughout the village. Some were
satisfied that witchery was no longer to be feared,
but others still held their belief. In course of time,
however, the witch acts believed of Jane Walford
were forgotten.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_WOLVES_OF_PORTSMOUTH" id="THE_WOLVES_OF_PORTSMOUTH"></a>THE WOLVES OF PORTSMOUTH.</h2>

<p>John Hinkson led his saddled horse from the
stable one September morning in 1662. Things had
gone hard with John, for taxes were due, and bills
were demanding immediate payment. As he needed
money at once, he was now starting for Exeter
to borrow, if possible, from his brother Peter, until
his grist-mill should bring him the fall returns.</p>

<p>As he mounted the horse, his wife opened the
door.</p>

<p>"John," she asked, "if you go to Peter's home, do
not fail to ask Miranda for a bottle of her pine
syrup. I ought not to be without it, for already
little Anthony has a heavy cold. When shall you
be back?"</p>

<p>"I must return on Wednesday," John replied,
"for there is to be a town-meeting that afternoon."
Then, adjusting his gun, he called, "Good-bye," and
was off.</p>

<p>When Wednesday came, and the townsmen had
gathered at their meeting, John Hinkson was not
there. Thomas Keats, whose home was on the outskirts
of Portsmouth, reported that Hinkson had
passed his house on the way to Exeter a day or two
before, but had not yet returned. Richard Webster
remarked that he had just spoken with Mrs.
Hinkson at her gate. She was looking anxiously
for John. Their boy was seriously ill, and she needed
the medicine John would bring. She was equally
worried lest in his delay night should overtake
him, when there was grave danger of attack by
wolves. Another townsman emphatically declared:</p>

<p>"It seems as if measures should be taken immediately
to overcome this pest of wolves. There is no
safety in the woods after dark, and even our door-yards
are in danger from straggling beasts. Since
Portsmouth has grown to be a town of a hundred
inhabitants, though we are widely scattered, w<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>e
ought to be able to make some headway against
them."</p>

<p>The meeting was then called to order, and that
very question was placed under formal discussion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, John Hinkson had reached Exeter,
only to find that his brother was crippled for funds
and could give him no help. He obtained the syrup
that his sister-in-law had made from the pine sap
and, after indulging in a short visit, made an early
start for home.</p>

<p>The roads were very rough, and the horse loosened
a shoe on the way. His progress was so slow that
darkness had overtaken Hinkson by the time he had
reached the isolated home of Thomas Keats on the
edge of Portsmouth.</p>

<p>The rider kept on his way, hoping that the distant
cries he heard might not come nearer. He
was less than half a mile from Keats' home when
the howl of the wolves became more distinct.
Soon he knew that a pack was on his trail. The
horse seemed to sense his master's fear and dashed
forward. At a bend in the path Hinkson turned
and caught the gleam of the fiery eyes in full speed
behind him. He fired, and the pack stopped to devour
the fallen leader, while the horse plunged on.
Again Hinkson's good aim brought another wolf to
the ground, but a few of the pack, mad with the
taste of blood, kept on in hot pursuit. Hinkson
brought down a third and dodged a fourth that
sprang at the horse's flanks. Again the wolf ju<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>mped
and would have crippled horse and rider had not
the crack of another gun sounded upon the frosty
air. It belonged to Thomas Keats, then on his way
home from town meeting. The wolves, frightened
by the double-attack and weakened in numbers,
slunk away into the woods.</p>

<p>"This is a lucky shot for you, Hinkson," called
Keats. "The town today voted a bounty of five
pounds for every head, provided the nearest neighbor
would stand witness that they were shot within
the town's boundaries. I'm that neighbor, and
I'll stand witness for you." Then, as John Hinkson
fastened his bloody trophies to the saddle,
Keats added, "The heads must be nailed to the
meeting-house door."</p>

<p>The two men parted and later Hinkson rode into
his own dooryard, where he found an anxious little
wife.</p>

<p>She begged for the pine syrup, for her little Anthony
was choking with croup. One glance at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
saddle told of the story yet to be heard, but not until
an hour of troubled watching had passed could
she listen. The little boy then rested in comfortable
sleep, and John related to his wife his exciting
adventure with the wolves, adding, "I have brought
home four heads, which give me twenty pounds
bounty. With my good eye and my steady gun, I
can yet relieve the town of an even greater number,
and taxes at least will be paid."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_KINGS_FORT" id="THE_KINGS_FORT"></a>THE KING'S FORT.</h2>

<p>Little Peter White was so filled with the pride he
took in his older brother Thomas that he had no
thought for himself.</p>

<p>Thomas was just sixteen years old, which was a
very important matter that June of 1666, when King
Charles the Second of England ordered the harbors
of the New England colonies fortified.</p>

<p>Although the King's Commissioners had had some
trouble with the General Court, nevertheless, the
Governor and Council of Massachusetts had appointed
a committee to visit the New Hampshire settlements
and determine upon the most suitable
place for a fort. The eastern point of Great Island,
now known as New Castle, had been the spot selected.
The matter of building had been left to the
decision of the townsmen of Portsmouth.</p>

<p>Now it happened that little Peter was feeding his
pet rabbits with plantain just outside the doors of
the town-meeting that afternoon of June 19th. As
the dignified men adjourned from the gathering,
they still discussed the measures adopted for the
erection of the fort. Peter's sharp ears overheard
the mystic words "sixteen years." Had not his
Thomas reached that wonderful age? They must
be speaking of him. Peter caught every word that
followed, and although the conversation was not
about his Thomas, it was of utmost interest to Peter.</p>

<p>With a white rabbit under one arm and a brown
bunny bulging from the other, Peter ran full tilt
down the beaten path to his snug home on the river
bank, where Thomas was weeding the garden.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom," cried the little fellow excitedly, "you
are to help build the King's Fort at Great Island, because
you are sixteen years old." This surprising
news was explained a few minutes later when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
boys' father returned from the meeting.</p>

<p>Eager to learn what was meant, Tom rested on his
rake with an inquiring look in his eyes. Mrs. White,
who from within the house had caught Peter's
words, had come to the rose-arbored doorway, while
Peter, still hugging his rabbits, called, "Tell them,
father."</p>

<p>"It has been voted," explained Abram White,
"that every dweller in this town, above the age of
sixteen years, shall promise a week's work on the
new fort before next October. He must be there
from seven in the morning until six at night and
will be paid three shillings a day. The King has
sent eleven guns, six pounders, to defend the fort."</p>

<p>"Just think, Tom, you're to work on the King's
fort!" exclaimed little Peter, fairly bursting with
brotherly pride, for a direct order from the King
seemed to the little boy a great honor.</p>

<p>"That will mean another pound for Harvard,"
replied practical Tom as he bent again to the rake.</p>

<p>Harvard College, the only institution of learning
in the country at that time, was the ambition of
many a growing lad in the remote districts.</p>

<p>When the call actually came for Tom to work on
the fort, Peter announced, "I'll do the home work
while Tom's away. I'll weed the gardens and drive
the cows to pasture."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll be my right-hand man," declared his
father with a gentle slap on the little fellow's back.</p>

<p>For six days Tom had taken the early start, rowing
down the river to Great Island and then at a
brisk pace crossing it to the ocean side, where fortifications
were being erected for protection from
attack by sea. On the last morning his father,
whose week was just beginning, accompanied him.</p>

<p>Peter in consequence felt himself doubly important
as the only man at home. In the forenoon as
he was passing the boat-landing, he chanced to see
the basket containing the dinners which had been
forgotten.</p>

<p>"They must have it," thought Peter and stepped
into the one remaining boat, which he pushed into
the stream.</p>

<p>Peter had had little experience alone on the water.
So interested was he in watching the boat swing into
the current of the outgoing tide, that he did not
notice the darkening clouds above. Soon there
came a flash followed by the deep roll of thunder.
The swift Piscataqua tide held the boat amid
stream, and the small arms could turn it neither to
the right nor the left. Flash and roar repeatedly
followed each other. The boat swung past the usual
landing on Great Island and on down the river. As
the wind tossed the water into white-caps, Peter,
who had long before pulled in the oars, clung frightened
to the sides. On sped the small craft until it
had rounded the curve to the great ocean beyond.</p>

<p>Dinner time had come for the men at the fort,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> but
Tom and his father, with nothing to eat, stood on the
rocks, watching the ocean toss in this yet rainless
storm.</p>

<p>Suddenly a little boat swept into sight from the
river. Above its side was seen a small head too
far away to be recognized. Instantly the two
watchers, with the same thought, dashed for a boat
drawn up on the shore. Pushing it off, they jumped
in and grasped the oars. With strong, even strokes
they made steady headway, while the stray boat
plunged on and out into the sea. It was a mighty
pull even for sturdy arms, but nearer and nearer
they came until they saw the pale, frightened face
of their own little Peter. With redoubled energy,
they overtook the little fellow and held his boat
while he scrambled into theirs, announcing, as he
lifted the lunch basket over, "I was bringing your
dinner to you."</p>

<p>Thankfully they carried him safe to shore, where
together they ate with relish the rescued dinner.</p>

<p>Early that afternoon Peter's father took him
home to relieve the anxiety he knew the boy's
mother must be feeling.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>When Tom returned that night with his newly-earned
shillings, he passed half of them over to
Peter.</p>

<p>"There, Pete, put them aside for college. Harvard
will want such a man as you will make."</p>

<p>Peter went to bed that night, happy with the new
thought that he, himself, might some day go to
college.</p>

<h2><a name="LITTLE_JANES_GENTIANS" id="LITTLE_JANES_GENTIANS"></a>LITTLE JANE'S GENTIANS.</h2>

<p>"Have you never seen a fringed gentian?" asked
little blue-eyed Jane. "If you will go down that
path with me, I'll show you where they grow."</p>

<p>Benjamin was about to follow, when his father
reined in his horse at the gate and called, "Come,
Ben, we must start for home!"</p>

<p>"Never mind," whispered little Jane, "I'll bring
one to you at the meeting-house on the Sabbath."</p>

<p>John Cutts lifted his boy to the horse's back, and
with the bag of meal behind the saddle they started
homeward over beaten paths through the woods to
the clearing, some two miles from the settlement.
This happened as long ago as 1671, when the fire on
the hearth was the only kind used. Benjamin was
glad to get close to it this cold fall night, as he listened
to his father's account of the many wolves shot
that week, whose heads, Benjamin knew, would be
hung on the meeting-house door until the captors
received their bounty.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning John Cutts examined his
musket closely, for he dared not start to meeting
without it. Indians as well as wolves were feared.
His wife sat on the horse behind him, and Benjamin
rode before. Traveling over the narrow paths, they
passed but few people on their way.</p>

<p>Sunday was a day of fear for Benjamin, for outside
the church door was built a large wooden cage
which held the stocks, while a pillory was constructed
on top, both of which were to hold in most uncomfortable
positions those who disturbed the meeting.</p>

<p>Inside the church his mother sat on one side, his
father on the other. Benjamin was always left at
the back with a row of boys under the piercing eye
of Nicholas Bond, the tything man, who kept strict
order with his rod and an occasiona<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>l nod to the cage
outside.</p>

<p>On this particular morning when Benjamin dropped
into his seat at the end of the row and near the
door, he thought seriously of the whispered word he
had overheard outside.</p>

<p>"Little Jane is lost. There are several searching
parties out!"</p>

<p>"This is the morning," thought Benjamin, "that
little Jane was going to bring me the gentians. I
wonder if anyone would think of searching that path
for her!"</p>

<p>He glanced at the unusual number of wolves'
heads hung on the door and thought of those still
living in the woods. The guns stacked by the doorway
suggested lurking Indians. His fear for little
Jane's safety so increased that he became restless
and soon received a sharp rap on the shins from
the tything man.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>It was during the long prayer when all heads
were bowed that his fear for Jane became greater
than his fear of the cage. Could it be that Nicholas
Bond was nodding? Benjamin slipped from his
seat, crept out the door, and flew down the road
outside. The risk was great, for if he should be
caught, the horror of the cage awaited him.</p>

<p>He was soon out of sight of the church and had
turned down the gentian path without meeting
any one. He knew enough of woodcraft to break
a branch here and turn a stone there to mark his
way. The gentians were found, and some had been
picked, but Jane answered none of his shouts. He
returned the same way until he found a branching
path.</p>

<p>"She might have taken that by mistake," he
thought.</p>

<p>It was a long search before Benjamin came upon
the little girl asleep on the ground, with her hands
full of gentians. "Oh, Jane, Jane, wake up and
come quickly! The wolves or the Indians might
find us!"</p>

<p>Together they ran down the path to the turn and
up the right one to the church, which they reached
just as the people came out, troubled by the disappearance
of Benjamin. A searching party came from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the opposite direction, and Jane's father caught his
little girl up in his arms, while Benjamin told his
part of the story. His father proudly patted him on
the back and swung him up on the saddle, but little
Jane scrambled to her feet and darting to his side
reached up her plump little hand, exclaiming, "I
picked these gentians for you, Benjamin!"</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CHURCH_LAW" id="THE_CHURCH_LAW"></a>THE CHURCH LAW</h2>

<p>It was now 1675. Four years had passed since
Jane Fryer gathered the gentians for Benjamin.
Her father, Jonathan Fryer, had moved from the
neighborhood of the meeting-house far up the river-side,
where he found better land for cultivation.
He still held a strong church interest and built for
his family a small shed at the rear of the meeting-house.
Here they could warm themselves by a
hearth fire before the service in the unheated building
and take a hot dinner before the long walk
home.</p>

<p>Jane was now an energetic girl of ten. One February
afternoon she rested her bucket of water on
the icy edge of the well as she watched her father
striding homeward down the hill slope. As he
reached her, he picked up the heavy bucket and entered
the house, where his boy Tom was placing a
huge log on the fire, and his wife stood ready to fill
the kettle with water and hang it on the crane.
Jane had followed her father and waited with expectant
silence until Jonathan Fryer announced&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am going to Boston!"</p>

<p>"Father!" exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>"This winter?" asked his wife, while Jane embraced
her dearly loved father as if he were off
for the moon. Boston was fifty-eight miles away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>"I have just attended town-meeting," he explained.
"The sixty pounds which we have pledged
to Harvard College annually must be paid. There
are also town matters for consultation."</p>

<p>As it was February, Jonathan Fryer decided to
travel on horseback by an inland route to Boston.</p>

<p>During his absence, the family had cause for anxiety
in the weather. Storms and a moderating temperature
were bad, for Jonathan Fryer had frozen
rivers to cross.</p>

<p>On the night of the second Saturday after his
departure, he returned weary and exhausted from
a hard and perilous trip. Jane had spent many
hours watching for her father and was eager to
make him comfortable. She hung about him with
every attention, and laughed when he nodded with
sleep.</p>

<p>"Father, you must go to bed, for if your head
should tip like that in the meeting-house, the cage
would await you."</p>

<p>It had been decreed that the old wooden cage
before the church door should punish&mdash;"those who
use tobacco or sleep during public exercise."</p>

<p>The next morning Jonathan Fryer arose aching in
every limb. His family begged him to break his
custom of attending meeting, but his strong spirit
asserted itself, and he was ready at the usual time.
With a basket of dinner, the four started afoot at
an early hour that they might be well warmed before
meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. Moody, famous for his long sermons, had
preached some forty minutes when a lusty snore
brought the already straight listeners to an alert
posture. It awoke the sleeper himself, no other
than Jonathan Fryer. The preaching continued
to its customary length of an hour or more. Then
silently, shamed beyond endurance, Jonathan, his
goodwife, his Tom, and his Jane, sought shelter in
their small house. Words were useless. They
knew what would follow.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p>The tramp of four tything men was soon heard
crunching the ice. Some eight or ten men with that
title had been chosen to "look after the good morals"
of the neighbors of their home district.</p>

<p>Tything-man Eliot was the spokesman as the four
stood to administer justice.</p>

<p>"We regret, Goodman Fryer, that since you have
disobeyed the strict orders of the Church, not only
by sleeping, but also by disturbing the meeting
with an audible snort, we must comply with our
laws and place you in the stocks, within the cage
built for that purpose."</p>

<p>There was no chance for reply, for like a tiger
Jane pounced before these men of dignity and burst
forth, "It is not right. My father, in service for the
town, has faced great hardships and almost lost his
life. That he came to meeting at all, he should be
thanked. If you place him in the stocks, you shall
place me there too!"</p>

<p>Her flashing eyes and angered face seemed to
burn themselves into the stolid four as she stamped
her foot for emphasis. The spokesman turned and
quietly remarked to his companions, "There is need
for further council!" They left. Jane threw herself
into her father's arms. He dropped his head.</p>

<p>"My daughter, this conduct doubles the insult to
the Church. Your action is unrighteous, though
well meant. Your father's disgrace was great
enough, but this from a child to our worthy tythin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>g
men cannot be overlooked. There was need for
further council."</p>

<p>No greater punishment could have been given
Jane than these words from her father. The barley-cakes,
porridge, and cheese were left untouched by
the shame-faced group.</p>

<p>Soon the heavy steps were again heard. The moment
of suspense was stinging. The door opened
and the tything men entered. The same spokesman,
perhaps the gentlest of the four, began:</p>

<p>"Goodman Fryer, it is deemed best that the punishment
to be administered to your untamed daughter
for her unruly tongue shall be determined by her
parents. It is left to their discretion. Yet there is
truth in her words. The council of the Church
commends you for your recent service to the town
and grants you pardon for your unseemly conduct
in the meeting."</p>

<h2><a name="PEACE_OR_WARFARE" id="PEACE_OR_WARFARE"></a>PEACE OR WARFARE</h2>

<p>Since the days when Nonowit had welcomed the
English to his shores and had taught Roger Low the
ways of the wood, there had been little serious
trouble between the white man and the red.</p>

<p>The New Hampshire coast was at this time fortified
against an enemy from over the seas, but the
homes were rarely protected by palisades, save the
larger ones used as garrison houses, where the
neighbors gathered in case of an attack by Indians.
Up to this time, however, there had been but little
need of the garrisons.</p>

<p>Roger Low had become the father of Jonathan,
and even Jonathan now had a boy Robert, for some
fifty years had passed since Robert's grandfather
had crossed the ocean to this land. The Portsmouth
house in which the three lived had been the scene
of Jonathan's boyhood and recalls the time when his
little sister, Mary, cut off her father's hair.</p>

<p>The winter months of 1675 had passed. Frightful
stories of Indian troubles were coming to the ears
of the colonists. Robert Low had loved to sit on
his grandfather's knee and in the warm light of
the hearth fire to listen to stories of Indian life and
of Nonowit, of whom nothing had been heard for
many years.</p>

<p>The two were sitting by the fire one evening, when
Jonathan Low, leaving them alone, had gone to
Exeter for the night. A neighbor happened in.
His face was grave, and he shook his head in doubt
as he seated himself on the opposite settle.</p>

<p>"Philip, that chief in Massachusetts, the son of
Massasoit, is a dangerous fellow. He is turning
his Indians against the white men. And have you
heard what has happened on the Saco River, at
our east?"</p>

<p>Robert was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>alert for a new story, though his interest
was now mingled with a sense of fear.</p>

<p>"The squaw of the sachem Squando," continued
the caller, "was crossing the river in a canoe with
her pappoose, when two sailors upset the craft just
for the sport of it. The child sank, but the mother
dived to the bottom and brought it up alive. Later
the child died, and Squando is now rousing the
Indians of the east against the colonists. With
Philip south of us and Squando, a chief of wide influence,
at the east, we stand in great danger."</p>

<p>"Yet peace must exist between the white man and
the red," confidently replied the grandfather, "for
Passaconaway, the great sachem of the Penacooks,
that wonderful chieftain, fifteen years ago urged
peace when he called the river and the mountain
Indians together at Pawtucket Falls. At a great
dance and a feast held there Passaconaway spoke to
his people and bade them live in peace, for it was the
only hope for the race. They might do some harm
to the English, but it would end in their own destruction.
This the Great Spirit had said to him.
Then," continued Roger Low, "he gave up his chieftainship
to his son Wonolancet, who has heeded his
father's warning, as have other tribes about us.
They had faith in old Passaconaway, who had the
power to make water burn and trees to dance. He
could even turn himself into a flame. Yet he accepted
our Christianity as preached by John Eliot and
finally, the Indians say, he was carried in a sleigh
drawn by wolves up the slope of our highest mountain,
whence he rose toward the heaven of the white
man in a chariot of fire."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>The neighbor again shook his head doubtfully and
bade them good-night. Little Robert, torn by the
fears of the Indian raids, and his grandfather's assurance
of peace, lay awake many hours. His
grandfather was breathing heavily in his sleep,
when Robert distinctly heard a footstep outside.
Thinking his father might have returned, he hurried
to the window in time to see the figure of an Indian.
The little boy threw himself upon his sleeping grandfather
in fright. As the old gentleman awoke, a
heavy knock was heard at the door.</p>

<p>"'Tis an Indian, grandfather," shrieked the boy.</p>

<p>At that moment the outline of the Indian's face
was seen at the window which he was trying to open.
Roger Low jumped from his bed, seized his gun, and
stood ready for an attack. The Indian spoke.
Low dropped his gun and listened. Something more
was said outside, Grandfather hastily unbolted the
door. "Was he mad?" He seemed eager to meet
the Indian. Then Robert heard his grandfather cry,
"Nonowit!" for the old-time friend had at last come
back.</p>

<p>They stirred the fire and seated themselves to hear
Nonowit's story of peace and trouble between whitemen
and Indians. Robert gained no promise of
peace. However, the friendliness of such a powerful
Indian as Nonowit was reassuring, and he dropped
to sleep in his grandfather's arms.</p>

<h2><a name="SUSANNAS_RESCUE" id="SUSANNAS_RESCUE"></a>SUSANNA'S RESCUE</h2>

<h3>A Tale of 1675</h3>

<p>Toby Tozer dropped the rock which would have
completed his house of stones, as he saw a sail
tacking across the river straight to his point at
Newichewannock.</p>

<p>"Look, Susanna! Here comes Mistress Lear, and
she has brought Henry with her," he cried excitedly.</p>

<p>Susanna hurried up the bank to carry the news.
She was a sturdy girl of eighteen, with neither home
nor people. The little group at the settlement took
care of her, and she gratefully served them all.</p>

<p>Hearing of the arrival, Mistress Tozer hurried to
the shore, bidding Susanna notify the few neighbors
and invite them all to her home for the day. Spinning,
weaving, and other household cares were always
pushed aside for such an occasion as a visit.</p>

<p>"And may we keep her for days, Jacob?" Mrs.
Tozer asked anxiously of Mr. Lear, who was then
pushing off his boat.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>
<p>"Just an over-night trip," he called. "I'm on my
way to Dover and will come around for her on my
return."</p>

<p>Already the good-wives, with knitting in hand,
were gathering to greet Mistress Lear. Some fifteen
or more, including the children, were soon settled
about the Tozer fireplace, eager to learn of the
happenings in Portsmouth.</p>

<p>"How dared you come so far, Mistress Lear, when
the Indians are committing such terrible deeds?
Since King Philip has stirred up the creatures in
Massachusetts, even the settlements of Maine have
felt their treachery."</p>

<p>By this time Susanna had caught the winks and
nods of Toby and Henry, who were tired of sitting
primly on the settle.</p>

<p>"Shall I draw you a bucket of water, Mistress
Tozer?" asked Susanna, as eager as the boys for an
excuse to get out to the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>open. She glanced at the
boys, who followed to help her. Secretly she held
the fear of an Indian attack and, for days, had
been keeping watch over the river.</p>

<p>"My great-grandfather, Ambrose Gibbons, dug
this well!" exclaimed Henry, knowingly, as Susanna
let down the bucket. "His little girl, Becky Gibbons,
was my grandmother, and she traded some
corn for a beaver skin with the Indians."</p>

<p>Since Susanna and Toby seemed interested, Henry
continued his story as they turned to the shore.
"Almost all the Indians were friendly in those days,"
he added.</p>

<p>"But they are not now," replied Susanna. Her
alert eye, at that moment, had caught a distant
movement of paddles on the water. As a nearer
view brought the dreaded Indians to sight, she cried,
"Run for your lives, boys!"</p>

<p>The frightful feathered savages were gliding
straight toward the point.</p>

<p>The two children made a mad dash for the house.
Susanna, ahead, broke into the peaceful group
gathered there.</p>

<p>"Indians! Run! Out the back door, over the
fence to the Knight's house! Don't let them see
you!"</p>

<p>Susanna slammed the front door and threw her
full weight against it, whi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>le the women in mad haste
rushed through the narrow doorway and scrambled
over the fence to the more secure protection of the
neighboring house. A moment later the howling
Indians slashed their tomahawks into the door
which Susanna, to gain time for the others, still
held. The savages now forced the door open. The
girl was thrown to the floor by the blow, and the
Indians, thinking her dead, rushed through the
house. Finding it deserted, they dashed through
the back door on toward the neighboring house.
Shot after shot from this direction startled the
pursuing Indians and made them realize that their
party was too small to face such fire. They then
wheeled about and struck for the canoe.</p>

<p>After a long and fearful waiting, Mrs. Tozer
crept cautiously back to her home, sure that Susanna
had been carried off captive. No, there she
lay on the floor by the door. Could it be that she
moved? Her eyes opened. Mrs. Tozer dropped to
her side and, with the assistance of those who had
followed, brought her quick relief. The girl was
tenderly cared for, and in time she entirely recovered
her strength.</p>

<p>When Henry Lear returned to Portsmouth, he
told a tale of Newichewannock life wilder than the
stories of his grandmother's day.</p>

<h2><a name="TO_THE_GARRISON_HOUSE" id="TO_THE_GARRISON_HOUSE"></a>TO THE GARRISON HOUSE!</h2>

<p>One September day in 1675, near their home on
the Upper Plantation, now known as Dover, Betty
Haines, a girl of ten, stood in the cornfield with her
little apron outstretched to hold the ears of ripe corn
her father was plucking. Suddenly her brother
Joseph, twice her age, bounded over the meadow and
into the field.</p>

<p>"Father," he cried excitedly, "the Indians have
made an attack at Newichewannock. They are
likely to be down upon us at any moment. The garrison
house is our only safety."</p>

<p>His mother, at the door of their home, caught
Joseph's alarming words and took immediate command
of the situation. The rest of the family hurried
in from the cornfield and followed her directions.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Get your heavy coat, Joseph! Betty, pack the
bread into that basket and ask your father to bring
down our heaviest blankets!"</p>

<p>"I hope nothing will happen to this nice home of
ours," sighed Betty as her father on their departure
locked the door.</p>

<p>"Nor to our corn either," he added, with a thought
of the winter's food.</p>

<p>Soon they established themselves in the largest
home of the neighborhood, which stood open in such
a moment of need. Mrs. Haines, ready and capable,
did her part for the neighboring families assembled
there, while Mr. Haines and Joseph lent
their aid to strengthen the fortifications of timber
outside and to erect a sentry box on the roof, where
guard was to be kept night and day.</p>

<p>As Joseph Haines took his turn to guard, the first
night of alarm, Betty crept up to the roof after
him and immediately cried, pointing across the
river, "Look there, Joe!"</p>

<p>A small glow of fire, seen in the distance, soon
brightened the whole sky with flames.</p>

<p>"Work of the Indians!" muttered Joe. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
word was brought the next day that two houses
and three barns with a large quantity of grain had
been burned that night by the Indians, Betty implored
her brother, "Oh, don't let them burn our
house, Joe!"</p>

<p>"No, little Betty, I'll see that they do not," he declared
with determination.</p>

<p>Later the report reached Dover of six houses
burned at Oyster River (a neighboring village) and
two men killed. The young men of Dover rose with
indignation at the insults of the Indians and begged
Major Waldron, commander of the militia, to grant
them permission to protect the town in their own
way. This request granted, some twenty of them,
Joseph Haines in the number, armed themselves and
scattered through the woods, hoping in that way
to find the lurking savages who were doing their
mischief in small groups.</p>

<p>Just at dusk Joseph, with one companion, took
his position in the woods near his own home.</p>

<p>"Hist!" came from his friend after long, patient
watching. The two were alert, for five stealthy
figures were seen to cross the meadow and linger
in the cornfield. Three of them began to pick the
corn, while two, approaching the house, gathered
sticks for a fire which they lighted. Their purpose
seemed to be to roast the corn, but the fire was
built dangerously near the house.</p>

<p>Joseph and his friend had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> become separated
from their companions. No signal could be given
without arousing the suspicion of their enemies.
After a whispered consultation, they cautiously
crept out of the woods and into the shadow of the
house. From there they suddenly rushed upon the
two Indians by the fire, striking them down with
the butts of their guns. Those in the cornfield,
hearing the commotion, ran for the woods and
escaped.</p>

<p>Mr. Haines, seeing the firelight in the direction
of his house, started at once from the garrison,
not knowing that Betty quietly followed him
through the darkness, even slipping through the
big gateway without being seen.</p>

<p>The fire had already caught the house, while the
young men were occupied in binding the prisoners.
Mr. Haines dashed to the well for water and returned
to find his Betty beating the flames with a
broom.</p>

<p>Mrs. Haines, missing Betty and suspecting that
she had followed her father, was on the spot by
the time Joseph had turned his attention from the
prisoners to find that the house had been saved
from the flames.</p>

<p>Word of the efficient guard at Dover was reported
by the escaping Indians, and no further attack
was made at that time.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><a name="MY_NEW_HAMPSHIRE" id="MY_NEW_HAMPSHIRE"></a>MY NEW HAMPSHIRE</h2>

<p>The Indian raids had told heavily upon the colonists
in the region of the Piscataqua. Scattered
gardens had been devastated; homes built by great
effort had been destroyed in a night; family circles
had been broken by death, or by capture, and the
colony had suffered the loss of strong young men
who were its mainstay.</p>

<p>John Stevens had been crippled by the tomahawk
of an Indian; his whole family and that of his
brother had been swept out of existence by the
same cruel hands, and all that was left was his
home and one little nephew, David.</p>

<p>"This country is ours now, David, and we must
hold it," he would say to the manly little fellow,
who was already facing the responsibilities of life,
though with arms too young to swing the axe or to
steady the plough.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>Glancing at the sturdy little boy, John Stevens,
unable to leave his chair, looked through the open
doorway to his cleared land and his forests, and
wondered how, to say nothing of protecting the
country, he could keep the boy and himself alive.
"David," he cried on sudden thought, "the garden
shall be yours and the forest mine. We will each
do what we can. I still have a strong arm left to
me and a sharp knife. The red oaks can be felled
and sawed at the mill. Here in my chair with my
knife I can shape the short boards into hogshead
staves. The town accepts them for taxes at twenty-five
shillings a thousand."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," added David, "Mr. Cutt, the merchant,
will have use for some."</p>

<p>Together the man and the boy, before the open
door, planned for the coming days until the twilight
had settled into night.</p>

<p>The simple home was remote, and neighbors rarely
dropped in. David took the necessary trips to the
Bank, as the upper end of the town by the river<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
was still called, or to the South End, where the
Great House stood with many smaller homes of the
town to the south of it. Always the little boy
started with this injunction:</p>

<p>"Learn all you can, David, of town affairs. Inquire
about the doings of the General Court. This
is our country, David, and we must know what
happens."</p>

<p>The cutting of staves proved to be a means of
meeting their simple daily needs. The abundant
forests everywhere prevented a demand for the
shipment of staves to other ports; so it was an exultant
David who came home one fall day with the
word that Mr. John Cutt, the wealthy merchant of
Portsmouth, wanted all the staves John Stevens
could make. They had proved the best of the kind
that Mr. Cutt had yet found. With the little that
David could do on the garden the two managed to
make a living. Yet all this effort to live was held
before David as a small matter compared with the
life of the country.</p>

<p>"You must remember, David," his uncle impressed
upon him, "that the country must live
whether we are here or not, and its life, lad, depends
upon what we can do for it while we are
here."</p>

<p>With this quickened interest in the big country,
of which he could see so small a part, David returned
from town early in January of 1680, with
stirring news for his uncle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Listen to this, Uncle John," he cried, excitedly,
"Our King in England has seen fit to separate New
Hampshire from the government of Massachusetts,
and he has appointed our Mr. John Cutt as President.
The Royal Charter is already here!"</p>

<p>John Stevens leaned forward, as if to grasp the
thought.</p>

<p>"Say it again, David, every word." Then, after
the boy had repeated the news, his uncle slowly
shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is a heavy responsibility for us, lad. We
have but four small towns in New Hampshire. Yet
I have confidence in the honored gentleman appointed
to lead us."</p>

<p>Actually to withdraw from the rule of Massachusetts
required time, during which period David
never returned home without bringing some interesting
news. One day it was, "Uncle John, Portsmouth
has seventy-one men who can vote; Dover
has sixty-one; Hampton, fifty-seven; and Exeter,
twenty." At another time he announced, "There is
to be an important meeting in March, to which
every town of New Hampshire is to send three representatives
except Exeter, which sends two."</p>

<p>On the 16th of March, the day of the General Assembly,
John Stevens sent the boy off to town for
the whole day.</p>

<p>"Learn everything for me, David," was his parting
command. "Do not miss a thing. And David,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
he added, impressively, placing his hand on the
boy's shoulder, "Remember always that this is your
New Hampshire." Then he counted the hours for
the boy's return.</p>

<p>When David reached the town he found three
other boys of his own age eagerly watching for a
sight of the gentlemen attending the Assembly.
Choosing an advantageous spot on the roadside,
David and his companions swung themselves to the
low, spreading branches of an oak, where they
patiently waited.</p>

<p>"Here they come," called Sam Cutt, who had
already seen these gentlemen arrive at his father's
house.</p>

<p>As the solemn procession of representatives from
New Hampshire's four small towns passed on their
way to the meeting-house, David slid from his
branch to the ground and in an erect position bared
his head and held his hat to his heart until they had
passed.</p>

<p>"Oh, see the sissy!" cried one boy from the tree,
pointing to David, when the riders had moved
along. David's face flushed, but with unusual self-command
he replied.</p>

<p>"Did you not know that those men are taking
care of our province, which is yet very small, and
that this is for us all a very serious and important
meeting that they are attending?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>
<p>The surprised boys who had expected to see
David slink away, slid down from the branches,
caught with interest in what he continued to tell
them of town and even state affairs. They asked
questions which he could answer. "Now I tell you,"
he added with authority, "you must remember always
that this is your New Hampshire." David's
knowledge of his country had so deeply impressed
and interested the boys that, when the General
Assembly adjourned, four hatless lads stood in respect
as the members passed, who honored them
with a salute.</p>

<p>When, at the close of the day, David reached
home he threw off his coat and warmed his hands
by the fire exclaiming.</p>

<p>"You should have seen the dignified gentlemen,
uncle. There were a dozen or more of them who
rode from Mr. Cutt's estate to the meeting-house.
They wore fine clothes, and swords at their sides,
and shining buckles on their shoes and knee bands.
The Rev. Mr. Moody preached a sermon to them
after he had offered a long prayer. Then the gentlemen
voted to write a letter to the General Court
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
of Massachusetts. Sam Cutt told me all about it.
He had asked his father what had happened there.
And, uncle, in this letter they thanked the Court
for the care and kindness given us while we were
under its rule. They explained that we did not seek
this change. It was only because it was the King's
wish that we were willing to accept the plan. Then
they begged the Court for the benefit of its prayers
and blessing in this separation. Sam said that it
was all very solemn. Uncle," David continued,
after a pause, "I kept feeling all day long, 'This is
my New Hampshire!'"</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BOWL_OF_BROTH" id="THE_BOWL_OF_BROTH"></a>THE BOWL OF BROTH</h2>

<p>One September day Mrs. Elizabeth Heard opened
the door of her house on the Cocheco River, in
Dover, and first looking cautiously about, a habit
bred by fear of lurking Indians, stepped out
with a bowl of hot broth, which she was about to
carry to a neighbor who was ill.</p>

<p>The Heard house was a garrison with a protecting
wall built about it, the gate of which, Mrs.
Heard at this moment noticed had been carelessly
left open. A few months of peaceful living had
caused the younger members of the family to grow
careless of the once needed caution. Now about to
pass through this gateway the quick movement of a
shadow beyond the well, caught her eye. Bravely
approaching the spot, she discovered, crouching
there, a young Indian whose face instantly told more
of fear than of daring. Instinctively her mother-heart
felt sorry for him, and she offered him the
bowl of hot broth. He drank it eagerly and then
begged her to hide him. Without a moment's hesitation,
she led him to the garret of her house and
there in a corner concealed him under a pile of
blankets. It was fortunate for her scheme that her
family of ten, five boys and five girls, was off on a
fishing trip.</p>

<p>Later, on their return, they brought the news of
a large capture of Indians made in the town that
day. Mrs. Heard said nothing of the one then hidden
under their own roof.</p>

<p>After the children had been tucked into bed,
and she had made the rounds of the rooms to be
sure that all were sleeping, she crept to the garret
and signaled to the Indian that his moment of escape
had come. Noiselessly and swiftly he made
his way out.</p>

<p>Some thirteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> years passed, and the children of
the Heard family were well grown. One June day
in 1689, Mrs. Heard, three of her sons, a daughter
and some friends, had taken a river trip to Portsmouth
and were returning by night. As they approached
Dover, where their home still stood, they
heard many unusual sounds.</p>

<p>"I fear the Indians may be in the town, Benjamin,"
remarked Mrs. Heard to her oldest son, with
some alarm.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," replied Benjamin, "we had better go
right to the Waldron's garrison, since it is so near.
I see lights there."</p>

<p>The party, filled with fear, hastened to the house
suggested and knocked at the outer gate.</p>

<p>"Let us in!" they pleaded. No answer, however,
came from the home within. Benjamin then
climbed the wall and looked over the top. To his
horror, he saw an Indian, armed with a gun, standing
in the open doorway of the house. Benjamin
had not been seen, and the confusion within had
drowned the cries outside. Jumping down, he
started his party with utmost speed to their own
garrison house. They had not gone far, before, to
his dismay, he realized that his mother was not with
them.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i118.jpg">
<img src="images/i118-th.jpg" width="400" height="486" alt="" title="" /></a>
</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>He returned to the scene of their peril to find his
mother, exhausted by fright, still at the gate. She
was lying there unable to move.</p>

<p>"Go," she implored him in a whisper, "and help
the others to safety! I will come as soon as my
strength returns." At that moment a cry of fear
from the others, and his mother's last urgent appeal
drove Benjamin to their rescue while his brave
mother was left to her fate.</p>

<p>Recovering a little, Mrs. Heard crept to some protecting
bushes where she lay until daylight, when
the gate opened, and an Indian with a pistol approached
her. He paused and looked at her very
hard. Silently he left but returned immediately,
for another keen look. This time, his grim savage
face still unmoved, he grunted&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good squaw kept Indian boy safe! Indian no
forget!" Then he ran yelling to the house, with
some word for his friends who seemed to be there
in numbers.</p>

<p>Soon after the Waldron house burst into flames.
Not until the house had burned to the ground, and
the Indians had gone, could Mrs. Heard gather
strength enough to move. She feared the same sad
end for her own home, but, to her surprise, she found
it standing unharmed. Surely she had received her
blessing for the bowl of broth and aid to the Indian
lad, for her family and the friends, who had succeeded
in reaching the house, reported that they had
been free from attack through the horrors of that
night, which were long remembered by the people
of Dover.</p>

<h2><a name="THOMAS_TOOGOOD_OUTWITS_AN_INDIAN" id="THOMAS_TOOGOOD_OUTWITS_AN_INDIAN"></a>THOMAS TOOGOOD OUTWITS AN INDIAN</h2>

<h3>An Incident of 1690.</h3>

<p>"There, you clumsy thing, you've stepped in the
cat's saucer and spilled the milk. Be gone from
here," and the crabbed old aunt, who kept house
for the Toogoods, switched her broom after Tom as
he moved good-naturedly out the back door.</p>

<p>Thomas Toogood was overgrown, and awkward,
and seemed always to be doing the wrong thing.
He now sauntered out to the shed, where his father
was feeding the cows and his sister tossing grain to
the hens.</p>

<p>"Tom," said his father, pointing to a gun in the
corner, "I traded some corn for a gun for you, in
Dover yesterday. They say that wild ducks are
now found on the Cocheco. Thought you might like
to try for them."</p>

<p>Tom picked up the gun, looked it over, and said,
"All right," but the look of pleasure on his face told
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
that it was the first gun he had ever owned.</p>

<p>"Now that you have a gun," spoke up his sister
joyfully, "you can take me to the quilting party in
Dover, next week. All our friends are to be there."</p>

<p>Tom had reasons of his own for wishing to attend
that gathering, but he was especially pleased
to be considered manly enough to play the part of
escort. Though Dover was but a few miles away,
it was never safe to take even that trip without a
gun for protection.</p>

<p>With his father's suggestion of ducks in mind,
Thomas picked up his new gun and whistled his way
along the path to the river, where he kept his canoe.
As he pushed his bark into the stream, he thought
that he might now appease his aunt's anger by a
brace of fine ducks for dinner.</p>

<p>Two hours later poor Tom, dripping wet, with
one small bird in his hand, faced the assembled family
in the home kitchen.</p>

<p>"Where is your gun?" asked his father immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>.</p>

<p>"At the bottom of the river," replied the boy. "I
was reaching for my duck, and the canoe upset."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, you'd upset a sailing vessel if you
stepped on it!" came from his sister. "Now you
can't take me to the quilting party. It is just too
bad!"</p>

<p>"You go over to neighbor Roger's and chop his
wood," ordered Tom's father with disgust in his
tone. "I told him one of us would do it, for he is
bad in his limbs."</p>

<p>After changing his clothes, Tom started off to the
Roger's home, a good two miles through the woods.
The family attitude had dampened his usual good
spirits, and his sister's words had stung. An
afternoon's work of wood splitting brought cheer,
at least to the forlorn neighbors, and Tom started
home again whistling.</p>

<p>It was a bad habit, in those days, to make one's
presence known in the woods, and in this case Tom's
whistling proved most serious, for suddenly, he realized
that three dusky figures were creeping up the
hill slope behind him. Quick as could be, he bounded
up the crest of the hill and over the other side;
but quite as quickly came one of the three Indians in
hot pursuit. The other two, confident of their
companion's speed, waited below for him to return
with his prisoner.</p>

<p>Tom was too heavy to run far, and soon the Indian
had him in his ugly clutch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Name?" asked the Indian, taking Tom by the
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Thomas Toogood," was the boy's frightened
reply.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" grunted the Indian. Then, appreciating
Tom's clumsiness, the Indian loosened his grasp for
a moment to straighten some cords with which to
bind his captive. As the red man stooped with gun
under his arm, for an instant he turned his back.
Tom, for once in his life not slow, in a flash
seized the gun and aimed it at the Indian.</p>

<p>"You shout for help, and I'll shoot," he cried,
backing away, and then with more dexterity than
hitherto seemed possible, Tom continued to back
with gun still pointed at the Indian, who muttered,
"Tom no good, no good!"</p>

<p>Once out of momentary danger, before the Indian
could signal to the others, Tom had plunged into
the thicket and taken a short cut home. He was
again in possession of a gun, and he had met an
adventure which must command the respect of the
family and prove to his sister his worth as an escort.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ESCAPE" id="THE_ESCAPE"></a>THE ESCAPE</h2>

<p>"This, my little Dick, is a fine holiday for us,"
exclaimed Mrs. Waldron as she lifted her baby
from his hooded crib. "Your father has promised
an outing, and you shall go with us to the farm far
up the river. Some day, my little boy, you shall
gather the strawberries there yourself, and play in
the hay, and hunt for eggs."</p>

<p>As she tossed her baby while she chatted, he
seemed to be caught in mid-air by the tall soldierly
gentleman who had entered. After a moment of
play, Mrs. Waldron turned soberly to her husband.</p>

<p>"Now, Richard, will you use every argument
possible to persuade Madam Ursula Cutt to return
with us to Portsmouth? The French have so
stirred the Indians in the East that it is not safe
for her to remain on that remote farm."</p>

<p>"She has insisted," protested Col. Waldron, "that
the haying must be done first. Until the crop is
safely stored, it will be hard to start her. However,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the weather has been warm and dry, so it may even
now be done. Our boat is ready, can you go soon?"</p>

<p>It was a wonderful July day in 1694. Mrs. Waldron
followed her husband down the garden slope to
the sparkling river and had already passed little
Dick into his arms while she stepped into the boat.
A servant, hurrying over the arbored path, announced&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your friends from the Manor have arrived and
are waiting to see you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard," came in disappointed tones from
Mrs. Waldron, "we cannot take our trip. They have
come so far we must offer them at least a day's hospitality."</p>

<p>Regretfully they turned and cordially received
their guests. The plans for entertainment crowded
out all thought of the river trip and a day on the
farm.</p>

<p>The farm two miles up the river belonged to
Madam Ursula Cutt. It was a busy place, while
the Waldrons were detained at home that July<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
morning. Madam Cutt was over-seeing her household
affairs as well as keeping a watchful eye on
the hay-makers at work in the field. The maid at
the washtub remarked, as her mistress stepped to
the door with basket and scissors to gather flowers.</p>

<p>"Dover has felt the fury of the Indians. They
may yet come down the river!"</p>

<p>"It may be well for us to move into town as soon
as the haying is done," Madam Cutt replied, and
passed on to the garden.</p>

<p>The maid rinsed the white linen and lifting a
basketful stepped out to spread it on the grass to
dry. With the awful fear of Indians still on her
mind, she peered through the trees to the river,
half expecting to see the dreaded creatures bounding
up the bank.</p>

<p>The clothes were spread on the green when her
piercing gaze caught a strange movement of the
water. A second look discerned the curve of a
canoe. Madam Cutt was off in the flower garden.
The hay-makers were in the fields. There was
scarcely a moment in which to find shelter. Darting
into the grape arbor, the maid then crept behind
bushes and through uncut grass to the river slope
around the bend. At last she was hidden from
the farm-site. On she sped with all haste toward
the town. There was a gap of water to be crossed.
She found a boat and pulled at the oars in the direction
of Portsmouth.</p>

<p>While the Wa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>ldrons and their guests in the Portsmouth
home were gaily chatting at the table, cries
of "The Indians! The Indians!" were shrieked
through the hall, and the terrified girl in working
clothes rushed in exhausted.</p>

<p>As soon as she recovered her voice, she poured
forth brokenly, "The Indians&mdash;I ran&mdash;They didn't
see me!"</p>

<p>"But Madam Cutt, where is she?" asked Col.
Waldron.</p>

<p>"She was in the garden! She must be killed!
There was no time! I hid in the bushes, crept over
the meadow, and ran to the point, where I found a
boat!"</p>

<p>Col. Waldron ordered his horse and in a short
time had gathered a force and hastened to the farm.
It was all too true. The Indians had made their attack.
Madam Ursula Cutt had been killed and
robbed of her jewels. The three hay-makers had
been shot, and their scalps taken for trophies.</p>

<p>But little Dick, who might have been there, was
safely rocked in his own cradle that night and saved
to become Secretary Waldron, an important man in
New Hampshire history.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DEFENSE_AT_OYSTER_RIVER" id="THE_DEFENSE_AT_OYSTER_RIVER"></a>THE DEFENSE AT OYSTER RIVER</h2>

<p>Thomas Bickford viewed with satisfaction his
house and fortress now complete. Building in 1694
was attended with many difficulties, as John and
William, his sons, well knew, for they had helped.</p>

<p>"Boys, you've worked well. A holiday for you
tomorrow," promised their father.</p>

<p>Early the following morning the boys started off
on an exploring tour, for they had but recently
come to the Oyster River shores, several miles north
of Portsmouth where they had lived with their
grandmother.</p>

<p>The river had much to interest the boys. At
night they returned home filled with excitement
over the large hollow oak they had found almost a
mile below.</p>

<p>"It was just like a house, father. We planned
the rooms and played there all day."</p>

<p>"And saw no Indians?" their father inquired with
some anxiety.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, on the opposite bank we saw several creeping
up the river, but we had a fine hiding place."</p>

<p>The boys little knew that on that 17th day of
July, some two hundred Indians were stealing cautiously
up the Oyster River, on both sides, to the
Upper Settlement. Their plan was to divide into
small groups and attack each house at sunrise, the
next morning. A single shot was to be the signal.</p>

<p>On the following day by some mistake the shot
was given before the Indians were ready.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" exclaimed Thomas
Bickford, who from his home had heard the crack
of a gun far up the river on that early morning of
July 18th. Instantly he recalled the stealthy Indians
that the boys had seen the previous day, and
he sensed immediate danger.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he called to his wife and boys. "Run to
the boat! I believe the Indians are afoot!"</p>

<p>Hurrying into their clothes, they rushed to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
river and jumped into the boat. Bickford passed
them the oars.</p>

<p>"Down the stream," he pointed, "and get around
the bend as soon as you can! The savages are up the
river!"</p>

<p>"You are not coming?" they asked in alarm as he
remained on shore.</p>

<p>"No, that house is not to be lost, if I can save it!"</p>

<p>There was no time for argument. He pushed the
boat into the stream and darted back to the house,
bolting the gates of the palisade and then the door
as he entered. He grabbed his gun and placed his
bullets and powder-horn in readiness. He then
dashed upstairs quickly returning with an armful of
clothing, which he spread out upon chairs and tables.
At that moment the shots of the Indians struck the
house.</p>

<p>A horrible fear for the safety of his family
brought a shudder to Thomas Bickford, yet, though
alone in the house, he bravely began its defense.</p>

<p>"Steady there, shoot!" he shouted as if he had a
house full of men to command. He then pulled on
an old red soldier's coat and flashed past the window
in view of the Indians peering through the
chinks outside the palisade. With another loud
command and a remark in a different tone of voice,
Bickford tore off the coat, pulled on a fur hat, and
came again to view at the window. This he continued
to do with frequent changes of costume and
constant shooting and shouting until the Indians
lost c<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>ourage and fled for safety fearing an armed
band would soon rush out upon them.</p>

<p>Their flight brought but a moment of relief. The
house, perhaps, was safe, but what of the family?</p>

<p>Not until late in the day did Thomas Bickford
dare start forth in search of them. He crept along
the shore in the dusk, fearing each moment the shot
of some lurking Indian. On and on he went, yet
he found no trace of his people. At last he came
upon the hollow oak that the boys had described as
their playhouse. Here he paused, for a sound came
from within.</p>

<p>"Can that be a hiding place of the savages?" he
asked himself in alarm and quickly turned his
course. Suddenly there came from the oak a
stifled whisper, "Father!"</p>

<p>The family had but just escaped the sight of the
Indians that morning, and here in the hollow tree
they had crouched in fear all the long day. Now,
startled lest the sound they heard outside was the
tread of a redman, the boys peeped through a knothole
and saw their father.</p>

<p>To find each other was joy enough for one moment.
The next brought the whisper:</p>

<p>"Is the house saved?"</p>

<p>After dark all crept cautiously out to the hidden
boat, and later in the shelter of their home they
listened breathlessly to the story of its wonderful
defense.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ATTACK_AT_THE_PLAINS" id="THE_ATTACK_AT_THE_PLAINS"></a>THE ATTACK AT THE PLAINS</h2>

<p>"Scamper! The raindrops will get there before
you!" Mrs. Jackson scattered her children like a
flock of chickens to the green to gather up the
whitened linen which had been spread to dry on that
long remembered June day of 1696.</p>

<p>"There, Samuel, do stop that nonsense, for the
rain will soon be here!" she laughed in spite of herself,
as the round freckled face of her boy on hands
and knees appeared with a grin from beneath a
sheet.</p>

<p>The laughter of all three children increased when
the cows and sheep, in mid-afternoon, came hurrying
to the barns, as if they, too, were afraid of a
sprinkle.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jackson gave a troubled glance skyward at
the on-coming storm and then at the trembling cattle,
which had doubtless been frightened by something
worse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>Samuel, Betsey, and Peggy had glorious romp together
after supper, but neither father, nor mother,
nor even Uncle Jack, could be persuaded to tell them
a bedtime story, for something seemed to trouble
them all. The children went early to bed. Betsey
whispered, as they climbed to the feathers, "I
heard father say that we'd stay here one more
night. Do you suppose the Indians are coming?"</p>

<p>However, not even the dreaded word, Indian
nor the booming of the thunder storm outside could
keep those sleepy eyes open.</p>

<p>Downstairs the older members of the family and
several neighbors gathered about the wide fireplace,
glad of the warmth that chilly June night. With
sober faces they discussed the rumors of terrible
deeds the Indians had committed in Dover, a few
miles up the river.</p>

<p>"Some are lurking about us," declared Mr. Jackson,
"for no storm would so frighten the cattle. 'Tis
not the first time they have come home bruised and
bleeding."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tomorrow night," added his brother, "the settlers
here at the Plains must go to the garrison house
for safety. An attack may come at any moment."</p>

<p>Little Samuel was the first to open his eyes the
following morning, thinking it a glorious sunshine
that gave such a brilliant light outside. Suddenly
a snap and a crackle brought him to his feet.
He found the barn ablaze. A war-whoop from the
Indians then aroused the household.</p>

<p>While father and Uncle Jack armed themselves
with such implements as they had at hand, mother
gathered the children together to go with her to the
garrison house. About to leave the house she
missed her wallet, which she had left, and ran upstairs
to get it. She came down to find the children
gone.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they have started ahead," she thought,
and hurried out.</p>

<p>The children, left alone for a moment, frightened
and bewildered had run out the front door, for at
the back of the house were the Indians, yelling and
shrieking. Samuel had crawled into a familiar
hiding place under the cinnamon rose bushes, while
Betsey and Peggy had hidden beneath the low
branches of the lilac, so completely concealed that
they did not even see their mother come out of the
same door a moment later.</p>

<p>Here the children remained until the barns were
smoul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>dering ashes, and the Indians had fled. Samuel
was the first to creep from his hiding-place and
dash to the side of his father, whom he saw at the
front door. Betsey and Peggy followed, calling,
"Where's mother?"</p>

<p>"Is she not with you?" asked their surprised
father, grasping his children by the hands in his
thankfulness to find them alive, for the Indians
had left a desolated spot.</p>

<p>"Here comes Uncle Jack from the garrison house.
He will tell us where mother is," cried Peggy hopefully.
They all hastened to meet him, only to learn
that their mother had not been seen since she left
home.</p>

<p>"Did the Indians carry her off?" cried little Samuel,
choking back a sob.</p>

<p>Betsey relieved that awful thought by exclaiming,
"Here comes Captain Shackford with his soldiers.
They will find her."</p>

<p>The little group gathered about the sturdy Captain,
who had been summoned from the Bank, two
miles away. With his militia, he had reached the
Plains too late to meet the Indians. Seeing the
destruction they had caused, he inquired in which
direction they had fled and started in pursuit.</p>

<p>"Bring back my mother!" pleaded little Samuel,
running after the captain, who nodded doubtfully.</p>

<p>It was soon learned that four people were missing
from this little group of settlers; several were injured
and many had been killed. Nine barns and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
five dwellings had been burned.</p>

<p>"We have a house left to us," sighed Peggy, "but
what is that without mother?"</p>

<p>There was no time, however, for even the children
to mourn their loss; so many things were needed
from their home for those without homes, that they
were kept busy for several hours carrying pillows,
blankets, and other things of comfort to the injured
ones.</p>

<p>Suddenly little Samuel cried, "Here comes Captain
Shackford back again," for the Captain was then
emerging from the woods across the clearing with
his militia carrying kettles, lanterns, blankets, and
other things the Indians had taken as plunder.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Betsey with joy, straining her gaze
for a moment. "Mother is with them!"</p>

<p>The children dashed across the Plains, in wild delight
to escort their mother home. Her friends
gathered about and with the children still clinging to
her heard how the Captain had seen a feathery blue
smoke some four miles from the Plains and, approaching
it, had found that the Indians were cooking
their breakfast behind the protection of their
captives, who were tied to the trees. The soldiers
suddenly rushed upon the Indians, who escaped.
However, the plunder and, best of all, the four
prisoners were safely brought back.</p>

<p>Since then many a bedtime story by the hearth-fire
has been told of that spot, which to this day is
known as Breakfast Hill.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_STRAWBERRY_FIELDS_OF_EXETER" id="THE_STRAWBERRY_FIELDS_OF_EXETER"></a>THE STRAWBERRY FIELDS OF EXETER</h2>

<p>On a June afternoon in 1697, the silent forests
about the little village of Exeter felt an almost imperceptible
stir of life, for through it there stealthily
crept an Indian chief, followed by one and then
another of his frightful band. Each dressed in
tawny skins like the creatures of the wood and with
adornment of feathers from the very birds, they
seemed but a part of the forest life. No smoke of
the camp fire floated through the green boughs,
for in utmost secrecy these Indians took concealed
positions to spring, in the early morning, upon the
unguarded inhabitants of the town before they were
astir.</p>

<p>Now it happened on that same afternoon while
the sun shone alluringly upon the open fields, Patience
Nutter dropped her wearisome patchwork
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
and looked out of the window. A speck of red in
the grass outside the house caught her attention.
Her stint was not finished by several squares, yet
the temptation of that strawberry was too great.
Laying aside her work, she stepped out and popped
the luscious red berry into her mouth. Beyond it
she found a cluster of berries ripe and juicy. Step
by step she was led into the open field fairly riotous
in its growth of nodding red strawberries. It
seemed as if she could not pick them fast enough.</p>

<p>"Patience!" came a call from the house. The little
girl turned to see her mother in the doorway, holding
up the unfinished piece of patchwork. Reluctantly
she returned.</p>

<p>"Mother," she cried, as she entered the house,
"will you go with me for some berries after I have
finished my sewing? The field is full of them."</p>

<p>"Yes, child, we need some for supper. While you
are sewing, I will step into Mrs. Wiggin's, for she
will be glad to know that the berries are fully ripe."</p>

<p>Mrs. Nutter's news of the berries was of interest
to Mrs. Wiggin and her daughters, who picked up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
their baskets to start for the field at once.</p>

<p>Anthony Wiggin, who was sorting his papers at
his desk, shook his head with the warning:</p>

<p>"It is a great risk you run to go into that open
field without a guard. Indians may even now be
prowling about the woods."</p>

<p>Nevertheless the women started off for the strawberries.
Little Patience, with the strip of patchwork
dangling from her pocket, joined them so
quickly that one could almost believe some large
stitches had been taken on that last square.</p>

<p>When Anthony Wiggin had finished his work and
each paper had been placed in its proper pigeon hole,
he closed his desk.</p>

<p>"Hm," he muttered, glancing from the window at
the women and children in the field, "they do not
sense the danger we constantly live in, now that the
French have stirred up the Indians. I believe I will
frighten them with a shot, just as a warning."</p>

<p>He picked up his gun from the corner where it
was kept in constant readiness and, stepping to the
door, sent a bullet over the heads of the strawberry
pickers, whizzing into the woods beyond.</p>

<p>Baskets and berries were dropped by the pickers
in their fright and haste to get home, for their fears
had been aroused by the words of Anthony Wiggin
before they left the house. Patience, who had not
sensed a possible danger, had wandered near to
the woods where the berries were more abundant.

Even after the sound of the gun, she lingered for
a few more strawberries.</p>

<p>The shot acted like magic upon the inhabitants
of Exeter, who took it for an alarm of danger.
Men dropped plough or rein and seized their guns.
Women followed with powder-horns and bullets.
In less time than one could believe, an armed body
was in the village centre ready to protect their
homes.</p>

<p>That gun-shot carried its force still farther, for
there in the woods beyond the strawberry field lay
the Indians in ambush.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are discovered," reported their leader. The
savages then bounded into the open to make their
attack, only to find themselves faced by an armed
body of men. Firing a few shots, the Indians then
made a hasty retreat. One, however, seeing Patience
running for home and yet not halfway across
the field, dashed after her, caught the child in his
arms, and followed the retreating band.</p>

<p>"Patience! Patience!" shrieked her mother. "She
is captured! Oh, save her!" and the woman turned
imploringly to her townsmen.</p>

<p>They started in an almost hopeless pursuit, for the
speed of an Indian in the woods is hard to cope with.
Some dropped out of the chase, but the swiftest and
more persistent men kept at it, Anthony Wiggin in
the lead.</p>

<p>Hours of agonizing horror then passed for
Patience's mother as she pictured her own little girl
in the cruel clutches of the savages. She could feel
no possible hope of rescue.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
In the meantime the men continued a long and
wearying chase, when suddenly a distant glimpse
of an Indian was seen through the clearing.
Anthony Wiggin, still ahead, sent a shot and soon
after came upon little Patience alone in the woods.</p>

<p>It seems the Indians had stopped to parley, and
when they renewed their flight, Patience had been
picked up by the last savage in the line. As he
roughly seized her, she caught at the patchwork
dropping from her pocket and found her needle still
in it. Her indignation had by this time risen beyond
her fear. Quickly she thrust the needle so
far into the Indian's neck that he instinctively dropped
the child to pull it out. She ran back over the
path they had followed, just as Wiggin's shot was
heard. The Indian ran for his life.</p>

<p>As the full rising moon outlined the forest-tops to
the people of Exeter, a triumphant shout came from
the woods, and Patience, proudly shouldered by
Anthony Wiggin, was placed in her mother's arms.</p>
